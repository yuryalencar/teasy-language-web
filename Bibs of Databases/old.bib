abstract = {TRW has qualified a new advanced digital packaging technology for critical space applications; Plastic Ball Grid Array (PBGA) assemblies. This achievement enables use of high I/O, state-of-the-art ASIC designs and promises improved digital subsystem performance at significantly reduced weight and cost. Plastic ball grid array packages accommodating die as large as 17 mm sq. with over 800 I/O are planned on future satellite programs surviving extensive component-level and product-level qualification testing. TRW's space-qualification of laminate-based (organic) area array packaging technology responds to the ever increasing demand for reliable, cost effective, high density interconnect (HDI) solutions while leveraging the commercial standard plastic encapsulated microcircuit (PEM). This paper describes the product line approach used to produce qualification test vehicles representative of proposed flight configurations. TRW's radiation hardened 32-bit processor ASIC was used as an electrically functional test vehicle. The initial research focused on package reliability without hermeticity (RWOH) and solder joint reliability. Test results from a controlled insertion of plastic ball grid array packages on flight-like dual sequential laminated (DSL) boards are presented, where thousands of solder joints are continuously monitored using an inexpensive and highly reliable on-board fault detection circuit. The data demonstrates how this technology can provide a superior integrated circuit (IC) packaging solution over traditional ceramic-based assemblies. Space programs will benefit from aggressive insertion of JEDEC standard PBGA packages to achieve higher performance designs with increased circuit densities, while reducing electronic product's size, weight, power, and cost.},

abstract = {Electrophysiology of vision - especially the electroretinogram (ERG) - is used as a non-invasive way for functional testing of the visual system. The ERG is a combined electrical response generated by neural and non-neuronal cells in the retina in response to light stimulation. This response can be recorded and used for diagnosis of numerous disorders. For both clinical practice and clinical trials it is important to process those signals in an accurate and fast way and to provide the results as structured, consistent reports. Therefore, we developed a freely available and open-source framework in Java (http://www.eye.uni-tuebingen.de/projectlidsI4sigproc). The framework is focused on an easy integration with existing applications. By leveraging well-established software patterns like pipes-and-filters and fluent interfaces as well as by designing the application programming interfaces (API) as an integrated domain specific language (DSL) the overall framework provides a smooth learning curve. Additionally, it already contains several processing methods and visualization features and can be extended easily by implementing the provided interfaces. In this way, not only can new processing methods be added but the framework can also be adopted for other areas of signal processing. This article describes in detail the structure and implementation of the framework and demonstrate its application through the software package used in clinical practice and clinical trials at the University Eye Hospital Tuebingen one of the largest departments in the field of visual electrophysiology in Europe. &copy; 2010 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {Context: Behavior Driven Development (BDD), widely used in modern software development, enables easy creation of acceptance test case specifications and serves as a communication basis between business- and technical-oriented stakeholders. BDD is largely facilitated through simple domain specific languages (DSL) and usually restricted to technical test domain concepts. Integrating business domain concepts to implement a ubiquitous language for all members of the development team is an appealing test language improvement issue. But the integration of business domain concepts into BDD toolkits has so far not been investigated. Objective: The objective of the study presented in this paper is to examine whether supporting the ubiquitous language features inside a DSL, by extending a DSL with business domain concepts, is beneficial over using a DSL without those concepts. In the context of the study, benefit is measured in terms of perceived quality, creation time and length of the created test case specifications. In addition, we analyze if participants feel supported when using predefined business domain concepts. Method: We investigate the creation of test case specifications, similar to BDD, in a controlled student experiment performed with graduate students based on a novel platform for DSL experimentation. The experiment was carried out by two groups, each solving a similar comparable test case, one with the simple DSL, the other one with the DSL that includes business domain concepts. A crossover design was chosen for evaluating the perceived quality of the resulting specifications. Results: Our experiment indicates that a business domain aware language allows significant faster creation of documents without lowering the perceived quality. Subjects felt better supported by the DSL with business concepts. Conclusion: Based on our findings we propose that existing BDD toolkits could be further improved by integrating business domain concepts.<br/> &copy; 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many companies in the automotive industry have adopted model-driven development in their vehicle software development. As a major automotive company, General Motors (GM) has been using a custom-built, domain-specific modeling language, implemented as an internal proprietary metamodel, to meet the modeling needs in its control software development. Since AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) has been developed as a standard to ease the process of integrating components provided by different suppliers and manufacturers, there has been a growing demand to migrate these GM-specific, legacy models to AUTOSAR models. Given that AUTOSAR defines its own metamodel for various system artifacts in automotive software development, we explore applying model transformations to address the challenges in migrating GM-specific, legacy models to their AUTOSAR equivalents. As a case study, we have built and validated a model transformation using the MDWorkbench tool, the Atlas Transformation Language, and the Metamodel Coverage Checker tool. This paper reports on the case study, makes observations based on our experience to assist in the development of similar types of transformations, and provides recommendations for further research.<br/> &copy; 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Domain specific languages (DSL) are a popular means for providing customized solutions to a certain problem domain. So far, however, language workbenches lack sufficient built-in features in providing decision support when it comes to language design and improvement. Controlled experiments can provide data-driven decision support for both, researchers and language engineers, for comparing different languages or language features. This paper provides an evaluation of an integrated end-to-end tool environment for performing controlled experiments in DSL engineering. The experimentation environment is presented by a running example from engineering domain specific languages for acceptance testing. The tool is built on and integrated into the Meta Programming System (MPS) language workbench. For each step of an experiment the language engineer is supported by suitable DSLs and tools all within the MPS platform. The evaluation, from the viewpoint of the experiments subject, is based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). Results reveal that the subjects found the DSL experimentation environment intuitive and easy to use.<br/> &copy; Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract = {Regression testing is a form of software quality assurance (QA) that involves comparing the behavior of a newer version of a software artifact to its earlier correct behavior, and signaling the QA engineer when deviations are detected. Given the large potential in automated generation and execution of regression test cases for business process models in the context of running systems, powerful tools are required to make this practically feasible, more specifically to limit the potential impact on production systems, and to reduce the manual effort required from QA engineers. In this paper, we present a regression testing automation framework that implements the capture &amp; replay paradigm in the context of BPMN 2.0, a domain-specific language for modeling and executing business processes. The framework employs parallelization techniques and efficient communication patterns to reduce the performance overhead of capturing. Based on inputs from the QA engineer, it manipulates the BPMN2 model before executing tests for isolating the latter from external dependencies (e.g. human actors or expensive web services) and for avoiding undesired sideeffects. Finally, it performs a regression detection algorithm and reports the results to the QA engineer. We have implemented our framework on top of a BPMN2-compliant execution engine, namely jBPM, and performed functional validations and evaluations of its performance and fault-Tolerance. The results, indicating 3:9% average capturing performance overhead, demonstrate that the implemented framework can be the foundation of a practical regression testing tool for BPMN 2.0, and a key enabler for continuous delivery of business process-driven applications and services.<br/> &copy;2016 ACM.},

abstract = {Model-based testing is an effective black-box test generation technique for applications. Existing model-based testing techniques, however, fail to capture implicit domain-specific properties, as they overtly rely on software artifacts such as design documents, requirement specifications, etc., for completeness of the test model. This article presents a technique, HOTTest, which uses a strongly typed domain-specific language to model the system under test. This allows extraction of type-related system invariants, which can be related to various domain-specific properties of the application. Thus, using HOTTest, it is possible to automatically extract and embed domain-specific requirements into the test models. In this article we describe HOTTest, its principles and methodology, and how it is possible to relate domain-specific properties to specific type constraints. HOTTest is described using the example of HaskellDB, which is a Haskell-based embedded domain-specific language for relational databases. We present an example application of the technique and compare the results to some other commonly used Model-based test automation techniques like ASML-based testing, UML-based testing, and EFSM-based testing. &copy; 2006 ACM.},

One common approach is to have a domain expert instruct a QA developer to implement what she would do manually in the application. Though there exist record-replay tools specifically developed for this, these tend to scale poorly for more complicated test scenarios. We present a different solution: An Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) in F#, containing the means to model the user interface, and the various manipulations of it. We hope that this DSL will bridge the gap between the business domain and technical domain of applications to such a degree that domain experts may be able to construct automatic tests without depending on QA developers, and that these tests will prove more maintainable. &copy; 2012 IEEE.<br/>},

abstract = {Improving the maturity of the test process in an organization, especially but not limited to integration testing, involves obstacles and risks, such as the additional work overhead of the new process. In addition, integration testing descriptions are often too technical not addressing the language needs of the domain. In research cooperations with companies from the insurance and banking domain it turned out that test descriptions and reports are one of the most useful testing artifacts, while doing adhoc testing. This paper presents a bottom up testing approach, which first helps the integration tester in producing a semi-formal test description and report, up to be an enabler for automatic model-based testing in the very end. The presented approach is based on a textual domain specific language that is able to evolve over time. This is done by analyzing the test descriptions and reports automatically with machine learning techniques as well as manually by integration testers. Often recurring test steps or used components are integrated into the test language, making it specially tailored for a specific organization. For each test step implementations can be attached, preparing it for the next iteration. In this paper the methodology and architecture of our integration testing approach are presented together with the underlying language concepts.<br/> &copy; 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Hardware and software development of embedded systems interdependently gear into each other. Even more so if the device under development is intended for use in critical care facilities such as intensive care units. Especially in this case, safety measures and risk mitigation techniques are implemented using both hardware and software components. Thus applying hardware and software testing approaches in combination is inevitable as well. The increasing utilization of test domain-specific languages (Test DSLs), code generators and keyword-driven interpreters tends to raise the level of abstraction in test development. This approach aims to enhance productivity by generating executable tests from a non-programming language created for describing test cases. A second goal is to increase coverage by generating tests for as many as possible combinations of input values (black box test) or for all reasonable paths of a program flow (white box test). In combination with hardware-supported signal generation and fault injection this can be a very powerful strategy for testing safety-critical embedded devices. This article introduces an example of this strategy - the usage of a keyword-driven testing technique in cooperation with additional test hardware - in the context of an embedded medical device development, all the while emphasizing the benefit of combining different approaches. It discusses the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) testing hardware as well as the application of an in-house developed test box. It also highlights the integration of commercial software - for requirements engineering, test management and continuous integration - with a self-developed testing framework powered by its own keyword-based test DSL. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.<br/>},

In order to achieve a competitive edge, reduced development cost, timely product delivery, and product quality are mandatory in today's organization. Manual testing requires skilled operators that increase cost, time, and product delivery. The low cost computer based automated system helps to get an edge by fulfilling these organizational demands. In this paper, an automated testing system has been developed to support functional testing of Nortel Network's modem system (1-Meg SUT). The modem is an inherently complex asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) product and its testing is far more complex than just verification ofprocess faults. The complexity ofADSL system renders automated test system an important and imperative part ofADSL testing.

abstract={Cloud Computing and Mobile Cloud Computing are reshaping the way applications are being developed and deployed due to their unique needs such as massive scalability, guaranteed fault tolerance, near zero downtime, etc. and also daunting challenges such as security, reliability, continuous deployment and update capability. Microservices architecture, where application is composed of a set of independently deployable services, is increasingly becoming popular due to its capability to address most of these needs and challenges. In recent years, the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) has become one of the most popular agile software development processes, and frequently used in microservices development. The key to success of BDD is the executable acceptance tests that describe the expected behavior of a feature and its acceptance criteria in the form of scenarios using simple and business people readable syntax. The reusability, auditability, and maintainability become some of the major concerns when BDD test framework is applied for each microservice repository and no previous research addresses these concerns. In this paper, we present a reusable automated acceptance testing architecture to address all these concerns.},

This case study evaluates the effectiveness of such a solution as perceived by two teams of professional testers, who used it to test several products over a two year period.

abstract={Acceptance testing tools and Systems Under Test (SUT) require a gateway that will set up the communication link between them. Nevertheless, SUTs are often large systems composed of heterogeneous components that are executed in heterogeneous networks and platforms. Therefore, a non trivial communication problem between testing tools and these SUT heterogeneous components arises. A significant effort is invested in designing and implementing gateways for each specific component interface to cope with heterogeneity. This problem may be addressed through the use of middleware technologies that hide heterogeneity. However, this solution is too specific for each SUT domain. It may require a noteworthy effort to support the wide range of currently available interface standards that are provided by the different platforms and networks. An approach for testing heterogeneous components based on a generic gateway is presented in this paper. The generic gateway implements a service-oriented middleware named OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative). OSGi helps to solve the heterogeneity problem and reduces the impact of designing a gateway for each specific SUT domain. The solution has been validated using the acceptance testing tool TOPEN (Test and Operation ENvironment) in a home automation scenario.},

Henceforth, the steps are arranged in a dependency graph. This graph further leads to the creation of a decision table in which the outcome of one step leads to the outcomes of its dependent steps.

This allows development to be driven from tests that are created by developers and customers together, helping give all stakeholders confidence that the right things are being tested and hence a correct system being built.

abstract={The software market is becoming more challenging as demands for faster time-to-market and higher software quality continue to grow. These challenges are embedded in all areas of Software Engineering, including Verification and Validation where they are proposed as solvable with automated testing. However, most automated testing techniques focus on low system level testing and are not suitable for high level tests, i.e. System and Acceptance tests, leaving industrial needs for test automation unfulfilled. In this paper we present a research plan to evaluate a novel automated testing technique, called visual GUI testing, based on image recognition algorithms and scripts that interact through the system GUI to automate complex scenario based tests. The technique has been evaluated at the company Saab AB where industrial, safety critical, scenario based, test cases were automated showing the industrial applicability of the technique. However, many factors are still unknown regarding the techniques industrial applicability, i.e. script maintenance costs, usability and learn ability, etc. Our research aims to uncover these unknown factors with the final research goal to show that visual GUI testing is a viable and cost-effective technique that will fill the gap in industry for a cost-effective, simple, robust, high-level test automation technique.},

abstract={Model-Based Testing (MBT) popularity in IT is growing at a very slow pace. A recent survey stated that no more than 14% of respondents use MBT in their projects. Our experience, presented in this paper, demonstrates that the complexity in use of the current MBT approaches for the average tester is the main reason for this low dissemination. Then we introduce a lightweight MBT approach and a tool, called Yest, dedicated to business process-based testing of enterprise information systems. This tool uses a workflow-based graphical representation linked with decision tables to be used by functional testers without requiring any kind of modeling skill (such as UML for example). These approach and tool are dedicated to a particular class of applications (i.e. enterprise IT applications such as ERP and bespoke business applications). This focus strongly helps to simplify the approach and to adapt the tooling to the targeted users (namely IT functional testers). Finally, we discuss the way MBT may support emerging Acceptance Test Driven Development practices in agile.},

pages={286-297}, 
abstract={The core process a modeling method engineer needs to accomplish starts with the acquisition of domain knowledge and requirements, and ends with the deployment of a usable modeling tool. In between, a key intermediate deliverable of this process is the modeling method specification which, ideally, should be platform independent. On one hand, it takes input from a structured understanding of the application domain and scenarios; on the other hand, it provides sufficiently structured input to support the implementation of tool support for modeling activities. It is quite common that such modeling methods are domain-specific, in the sense that they provide concepts from the domain as �first-class modeling citizens�. However, for the purposes of this paper, we raise the level of abstraction for �domain specificity� and consider �modeling method engineering� as the application domain. Consequently, we raise several research questions - whether a domain-specific language can support this domain, and what would be its requirements, properties, constructs and grammar. We propose an initial draft of such a language - one that abstracts away from meta-modeling platforms by establishing a meta2layer of abstraction where a modeling method can be defined in a declarative manner, then the final modeling tool is generated by automated compilation of the method definition for the meta-modeling environment of choice.},

abstract={Automated testing of converged applications can be complex, as it is rare for a single testing tool to provide a single solution for all access points which a given application supports. As such, testing teams often create customized testing frameworks, which integrate several different testing tools, and a myriad of programming languages and scripting tools. When an applicationpsilas unique set of access points changes, or a new testing tool comes to market which offers a competitive advantage over existing test tools, the cost of updating these customized frameworks can be difficult to justify. This paper provides a solution to this problem by introducing ldquoPhotonese,rdquo a domain-specific language which testers can use to compose automation scripts which are independent of the test tool used for automation. In this way, the tester creates reusable testing assets in a framework which is reusable across multiple projects.},

abstract={In the modern era of mobile computing, context-aware computing is an emerging paradigm due to its widespread applications. Context-aware applications are gaining increasing popularity in our daily lives since these applications can determine and react according to the situational context and help users to enhance usability experience. However, testing these applications is not straightforward since it poses several challenges, such as generating test data, designing context-coupled test cases, and so on. However, the testing process can be automated to a greater extent by employing model-based testing technique for context-aware applications. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to automate model transformation, test data generation, and test case execution processes. In this paper, we propose an approach for behavior modeling of context-aware application by extending the UML activity diagram. We also propose an automated model transformation approach to transform the development model, i.e., extended UML activity diagram into the testing model in the form of function nets. The objective of this paper is to automate the context-coupled test case generation and execution. We propose a functional testing framework for automated execution of keyword-based test cases. Our functional testing framework can reduce the testing time and cost, thus enabling the test engineers to execute more testing cycles to attain a higher degree of test coverage.},

The contribution of this paper is closing the gap between the languages used by business domain experts and IT-experts in analyzing the relevant data. A well accepted approach for an accountability infrastructure is the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology. Although REA has been based on well-established concepts of the accounting theory, its representation has not been intuitive to domain experts. In previous work, we developed the REA-DSL, a dedicated and easy-to-understand graphical domain specific modeling language for the REA ontology. Evidently, a model-driven approach requires to transform the REA-DSL artifacts to code. In this paper we present the transformation of the REA-DSL to a relational database for AIS. This approach offers the advantage that a domain expert verifies the relevant data in an "accounting language", whereas the IT expert is able to work with traditional data base structures.},

abstract={Test automation involves the automatic execution of test scripts instead of being manually run. This significantly reduces the amount of manual effort needed and thus is of great interest to the software testing industry. There are two key problems in the existing tools &amp; methods for test automation - a) Creating an automation test script is essentially a code development task, which most testers are not trained on, and b) the automation test script is seldom readable, making the task of maintenance an effort intensive process. We present the Accelerating Test Automation Platform (ATAP) which is aimed at making test automation accessible to non-programmers. ATAP allows the creation of an automation test script through a domain specific language based on English. The English-like test scripts are automatically converted to machine executable code using Selenium WebDriver. ATAP's English-like test script makes it easy for non-programmers to author. The functional flow of an ATAP script is easy to understand as well thus making maintenance simpler (you can understand the flow of the test script when you revisit it many months later). ATAP has been built around the Eclipse ecosystem and has been used in a real-life testing project. We present the details of the implementation of ATAP and the results from its usage in practice.},

abstract={Multi-tenancy is sharing a single application's resources to serve more than a single group of users (i.e. tenant). Cloud application providers are encouraged to adopt multi-tenancy as it facilitates increased resource utilization and ease of maintenance, translating into lower operational and energy costs. However, introducing multi-tenancy to a single-tenant application requires significant changes in its structure to ensure tenant isolation, configurability and extensibility. In this paper, we analyse and address the different challenges associated with evolving an application's architecture to a multi-tenant cloud deployment. We focus specifically on multi-tenant data architectures, commonly the prime candidate for consolidation and multi-tenancy. We present a Domain-Specific Modeling language (DSML) to model a multi-tenant data architecture, and automatically generate source code that handles the evolution of the application's data layer. We apply the DSML on a representative case study of a single-tenant application evolving to become a multi-tenant cloud application under two resource sharing scenarios. We evaluate the costs associated with using this DSML against the state of the art and against manual evolution, reporting specifically on the gained benefits in terms of development effort and reliability.},

abstract={The rapid growth in simulation data requires large-scale parallel implementations of scientific analysis and visualization algorithms, both to produce results within an acceptable timeframe and to enable in situ deployment. However, efficient and scalable implementations, especially of more complex analysis approaches, require not only advanced algorithms, but also an in-depth knowledge of the underlying runtime. Furthermore, different machine configurations and different applications may favor different runtimes, i.e., MPI vs Charm++ vs Legion, etc., and different hardware architectures. This diversity makes developing and maintaining a broadly applicable analysis software infrastructure challenging. We address some of these problems by explicitly separating the implementation of individual tasks of an algorithm from the dataflow connecting these tasks. In particular, we present an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) to describe algorithms using a new task graph abstraction. This task graph is then executed on top of one of several available runtimes (MPI, Charm++, Legion) using a thin layer of library calls. We demonstrate the flexibility and performance of this approach using three different large scale analysis and visualization use cases, i.e., topological analysis, rendering and compositing dataflow, and image registration of large microscopy scans. Despite the unavoidable overheads of a generic solution, our approach demonstrates performance portability at scale, and, in some cases, outperforms hand-optimized implementations.},

Still, systematic testing for such performance regressions has largely been ignored in this domain. We present a method to specify and execute performance tests for individual components of component-based robotics systems based on their component interfaces. The method includes an automatic analysis of each component revision against previous ones that reports potential changes to the resource usage characteristics. This informs developers about the impact of their changes.

abstract={Electrophysiology of vision - especially the electroretinogram (ERG) - is used as a non-invasive way for functional testing of the visual system. The ERG is a combined electrical response generated by neural and non-neuronal cells in the retina in response to light stimulation. This response can be recorded and used for diagnosis of numerous disorders. For both clinical practice and clinical trials it is important to process those signals in an accurate and fast way and to provide the results as structured, consistent reports. Therefore, we developed a freely available and open-source framework in Java (http://www.eye.uni-tuebingen.de/project/idsI4sigproc). The framework is focused on an easy integration with existing applications. By leveraging well-established software patterns like pipes-and-filters and fluent interfaces as well as by designing the application programming interfaces (API) as an integrated domain specific language (DSL) the overall framework provides a smooth learning curve. Additionally, it already contains several processing methods and visualization features and can be extended easily by implementing the provided interfaces. In this way, not only can new processing methods be added but the framework can also be adopted for other areas of signal processing. This article describes in detail the structure and implementation of the framework and demonstrate its application through the software package used in clinical practice and clinical trials at the University Eye Hospital Tuebingen one of the largest departments in the field of visual electrophysiology in Europe.},

abstract={Improving the maturity of the test process in an organization, especially but not limited to integration testing, involves obstacles and risks, such as the additional work overhead of the new process. In addition, integration testing descriptions are often too technical not addressing the language needs of the domain. In research cooperations with companies from the insurance and banking domain it turned out that test descriptions and reports are one of the most useful testing artifacts, while doing adhoc testing. This paper presents a bottom up testing approach, which first helps the integration tester in producing a semi-formal test description and report, up to be an enabler for automatic model-based testing in the very end. The presented approach is based on a textual domain specific language that is able to evolve over time. This is done by analyzing the test descriptions and reports automatically with machine learning techniques as well as manually by integration testers. Often recurring test steps or used components are integrated into the test language, making it specially tailored for a specific organization. For each test step implementations can be attached, preparing it for the next iteration. In this paper the methodology and architecture of our integration testing approach are presented together with the underlying language concepts.},

abstract={The continuous increase of software complexity is one of the major problems associated with the development of today's complex technical systems. In particular, for safety-critical systems, which usually require to be thoroughly verified and validated, managing such a complexity is of high importance. To this end, industry is utilizing Model-Driven Development (MDD) in many aspects of systems engineering, including verification and validation activities. Until now many specifications and standards have been released by the MDD community to support those activities by putting models in focus. The general problem is, however, that applying those specifications is often difficult, since they comprise a broader scope than usually required to solve specific problems. In this paper we propose a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows to specify tests from the UML Testing Profile (UTP). The main contribution is that only particular aspects of UTP are captured, thereby allowing the MDD process to be narrowed to specific needs, such as supporting code generation facilities for certain types of tests or even specific statements in tests. In the end we show the application of the DSL using a simple example within a MDD process, and we report on performance of that process.},

Difficult-to-test program design styles are explicitly represented by domain-specific, unit test driver reference designs that accommodate the problematic program design styles. DSLs are developed to represent both TestSpecs and Driver reference designs. A DSL language processing tool (a translator) is developed that maps TestSpecs into Drivers.

pages={124-141}, 
abstract={Developers of highly configurable performance-intensive software systems often use in-house performance-oriented "regression testing" to ensure that their modifications do not adversely affect their software's performance across its large configuration space. Unfortunately, time and resource constraints can limit in-house testing to a relatively small number of possible configurations, followed by unreliable extrapolation from these results to the entire configuration space. As a result, many performance bottlenecks escape detection until systems are fielded. In our earlier work, we improved the situation outlined above by developing an initial quality assurance process called "main effects screening". This process 1) executes formally designed experiments to identify an appropriate subset of configurations on which to base the performance-oriented regression testing, 2) executes benchmarks on this subset whenever the software changes, and 3) provides tool support for executing these actions on in-the-field and in-house computing resources. Our initial process had several limitations, however, since it was manually configured (which was tedious and error-prone) and relied on strong and untested assumptions for its accuracy (which made its use unacceptably risky in practice). This paper presents a new quality assurance process called "reliable effects screening" that provides three significant improvements to our earlier work. First, it allows developers to economically verify key assumptions during process execution. Second, it integrates several model-driven engineering tools to make process configuration and execution much easier and less error prone. Third, we evaluate this process via several feasibility studies of three large, widely used performance-intensive software frameworks. Our results indicate that reliable effects screening can detect performance degradation in large-scale systems more reliably and with significantly less resources than conventional techniques},

abstract={WiFi P2P allows mobile apps to connect to each other via WiFi without an intermediate access point. This communication mode is widely used by mobile apps to support interactions with one or more devices simultaneously. However, testing such P2P apps remains a challenge for app developers as i) existing testing frameworks lack support for WiFi P2P, and ii) WiFi P2P testing fails to scale when considering a deployment on more than two devices. In this paper, we therefore propose an acceptance testing framework, named Androfleet, to automate testing of WiFi P2P mobile apps at scale. Beyond the capability of testing point-to-point interactions under various conditions, An-drofleet supports the deployment and the emulation of a fleet of mobile devices as part of an alpha testing phase in order to assess the robustness of a WiFi P2P app once deployed in the field. To validate Androfleet, we demonstrate the detection of failing black-box acceptance tests for WiFi P2P apps and we capture the conditions under which such a mobile app can correctly work in the field. The demo video of Androfleet is made available from https://youtu.be/gJ5_Ed7XL04.},

This transmission of 6 Mbps is achieved using sophisticated modulation and compression techniques in a spectrum up to 1.1 MHz, pushing the physical limit on the usable bandwidth in the copper. This technology co-exists with impairments, noise intrusions, bridge taps, and other non-spectrally compatible transmissions.

This strategy can precisely test various features of DSL broadband equipment and services which can be delivered by them in terms of different aspects of testing such as functionality, performance, conformance, etc. It was practically executed over a designed testbed in Iran Telecommunications Research Center (ITRC) where a lab named NGN Pilot exists. The introduced strategy has a hierarchical structure from the topmost level of testing including different categories to the bottommost level including detailed test topics and test cases. This paper elaborates how the strategy was designed and how it can be applied to a desired environment to compare different DSL scenarios with each other. The strategy can then be used by a service provider to help deciding which solutions can achieve the best outcome.},

abstract={Automatic program transformation tools can be valuable for programmers to help them with refactoring tasks, and for Computer Science students in the form of tutoring systems that suggest repairs to programming assignments. However, manually creating catalogs of transformations is complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we present REFAZER, a technique for automatically learning program transformations. REFAZER builds on the observation that code edits performed by developers can be used as input-output examples for learning program transformations. Example edits may share the same structure but involve different variables and subexpressions, which must be generalized in a transformation at the right level of abstraction. To learn transformations, REFAZER leverages state-of-the-art programming-by-example methodology using the following key components: (a) a novel domain-specific language (DSL) for describing program transformations, (b) domain-specific deductive algorithms for efficiently synthesizing transformations in the DSL, and (c) functions for ranking the synthesized transformations. We instantiate and evaluate REFAZER in two domains. First, given examples of code edits used by students to fix incorrect programming assignment submissions, we learn program transformations that can fix other students' submissions with similar faults. In our evaluation conducted on 4 programming tasks performed by 720 students, our technique helped to fix incorrect submissions for 87% of the students. In the second domain, we use repetitive code edits applied by developers to the same project to synthesize a program transformation that applies these edits to other locations in the code. In our evaluation conducted on 56 scenarios of repetitive edits taken from three large C# open-source projects, REFAZER learns the intended program transformation in 84% of the cases using only 2.9 examples on average.},

abstract={This book discusses how model-based approaches can improve the daily practice of software professionals. This is known as Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) or, simply, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). MDSE practices have proved to increase efficiency and effectiveness in software development, as demonstrated by various quantitative and qualitative studies. MDSE adoption in the software industry is foreseen to grow exponentially in the near future, e.g., due to the convergence of software development and business analysis. The aim of this book is to provide you with an agile and flexible tool to introduce you to the MDSE world, thus allowing you to quickly understand its basic principles and techniques and to choose the right set of MDSE instruments for your needs so that you can start to benefit from MDSE right away. The book is organized into two main parts. The first part discusses the foundations of MDSE in terms of basic concepts (i.e., models and transformations), driving principles, application scenarios and current standards, like the well-known MDA initiative proposed by OMG (Object Management Group) as well as the practices on how to integrate MDSE in existing development processes. The second part deals with the technical aspects of MDSE, spanning from the basics on when and how to build a domain-specific modeling language, to the description of Model-to-Text and Model-to-Model transformations, and the tools that support the management of MDSE projects. The book is targeted to a diverse set of readers, spanning: professionals, CTOs, CIOs, and team managers that need to have a bird's eye vision on the matter, so as to take the appropriate decisions when it comes to choosing the best development techniques for their company or team; software analysts, developers, or designers that expect to use MDSE for improving everyday work productivity, either by applying the basic modeling techniques and notations or by defining new domain-specific modeling languages and applying end-to-end MDSE practices in the software factory; and academic teachers and students to address undergrad and postgrad courses on MDSE. In addition to the contents of the book, more resources are provided on the book's website, including the examples presented in the book.

abstract={In 2007 I started work as a tester for a company called Socialtext. When I joined the company there was already a Selenium-based test framework in place, but there were only a couple of automated test cases created; we had about 400 test steps, or individual assertions about the behavior of the application. When I left Socialtext two years later, we had just surpassed 10,000 test steps in the main set of regression tests. We also had browser-specific test sets in place, an automated test case for visually checking the application, and a Continuous-Integration-like script that ran all day and all night against the latest version of the code. At about 4000 test steps, regression bugs released to production dropped essentially to zero. The other 6000 test steps covered ongoing new features in the project, and more robust testing of the older application functions. This report discusses how I helped grow this system, and the things we learned along the way that helped it be such a successful ongoing project. The report covers initial conditions and test design; discusses issues in application feature coverage; how and when to grow the system quickly; a couple of test design smells that caused us problems along the way; how we treat Continuous Integration in a system like this; and how we coped when significant parts of the User Interface were completely re-engineered.},

abstract={It is not uncommon for industries to use natural language to represent high-level software requirement specifications. It is also not uncommon for these requirement specifications to be translated into design and used further for implementation and generation of test cases in the software engineering life-cycle. These requirements are often ambiguous, incorrect, and incomplete. Finding them late in the development lifecycle proves very expensive and lowers the productivity. This paper reports on the experience of applying model-based technologies from academia to a real-world problem domain in the aviation industry to improve the productivity. The paper focuses on the application of a model-based technique to automatically generate test cases to satisfy Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) from high-level logic requirements expressed in a Domain Specific Language (DSL).},

abstract={While Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) are for many parts deployed online, and today often in a cloud, the testing of the systems still happens mostly locally. In this paper, we want to present the MIDAS Testing as a Service (TaaS), a cloud platform for the testing of SOAs. We focus on the testing of whole SOA orchestrations, a complex task due to the number of potential service interactions and the increasing complexity with each service that joins an orchestration. Since traditional testing does not scale well with such a complex setup, we employ a Model-based Testing (MBT) approach based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the UML Testing Profile (UTP) within MIDAS. Through this, we provide methods for functional testing, security testing, and usage-based testing of service orchestrations. Through harnessing the computational power of the cloud, MIDAS is able to generate and execute complex test scenarios which would be infeasible to run in a local environment.},

In order to autmatically generate tests, conditions such as invariants and pre-/post-conditions must be precisely defined.

This paper describes an approach that allows many commonly found OCL patterns to be expressed as snapshot patterns that correspond directly to the information model diagrams.

abstract={We present ACRE, an Automated aspect creator, to use aspect-oriented programming (AOP) to perform memory, invariant and interferences testing for software programs written in C++. ACRE allows developers without knowledge in AOP to use aspects to test their programs without modifying the behavior of their source code. ACRE uses a domain-specific language (DSL), which statements testers insert into the source code like comments to describe the aspects to be used. The presence of DSL statements in the code does not modify the program's compilation and behavior. ACRE parses the DSL statements and automatically generates appropriate aspects that are then weaved into the source code to identify bugs due to memory leaks, incorrect algorithm implementation, or interference among threads. Thanks to the use of aspects and ACRE, testers can add or remove tests easily. Using an aspect generated by ACRE, we find a memory leak in a complex C++ software program, NOMAD, used in both industry and research. We also verify a crucial mathematical point of the algorithm behind NOMAD and collect data to find possible interference bugs, in NOMAD.},

abstract={The introduction of modern model-driven software development methodologies into the industrial practise still proves to be a challenge. Especially small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need an incremental and continuous modernisation process, which incorporates existing projects, is customised and cost-effective. Particularly, suitable solutions for model-based or -driven testing with test automation to increase the efficiency are in demand. This paper presents an approach for integrating existing proprietary system models of an SME partner for describing industrial automation processes into a model-driven test process, utilising a domain-specific language for the test specification. The test objectives focuses on the correct implementation of the communication and synchronisation of distributed state machines. The presented approach is integrated into a test framework, which is based on the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) and the Eclipse Test and Performance Tools Platform Project (TPTP) framework. To separate the possibly changeable system and DSL-specific models from the implementation of the test framework, a stable and more generic test meta model was defined.},

abstract={Software systems are becoming more complex, not least in their Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), which presents challenges for existing testing practices. Pressure to reduce time to market leaves less time for manual testing and increases the importance of test automation. Previous research has identified several generations of automated GUI-based test approaches with different cost-benefit tradeoffs. Whilst test automation provides fast quality feedback it can be associated with high costs and inability to identify defects not explicitly anticipated by the test designer. TextTest is a capture-replay tool for GUI-based testing with a novel approach that overcomes several of the challenges experienced with previous approaches. Firstly the tool supports Approval Testing, an approach where ASCII-art representations of the GUI's visual state are used to verify correct application behavior at the system level. Secondly it records and replays test scripts in a user defined domain specific language (DSL) that is readable by all stakeholders. In this paper we present a three phase industrial case study that aims to identify TextTest's applicability in industrial practice. The paper reports that the tool is associated with (1) low script development costs due to recording functionality, (2) low maintenance costs, on average 7 minutes per test case, (3) better defect finding ability than manual system testing, (4) high test case execution performance (In this case 500 test cases in 20 minutes), (5) high script readability due to DSL defined scripts, and (6) test suites that are robust to change (In this case 93 percent per iteration). However, the tool requires a higher degree of technical skill for customization work, test maintainers need skills in designing regular expressions and the tool's applicability is currently restricted to Java and Python based applications.},

abstract={The requirement for an automated test system has immensely increased due to the realization that manual testing is associated with additional resources and staffing constraints. In order to achieve a competitive edge, reduced development cost, timely product delivery, and product quality are mandatory in today's organization. Manual testing requires skilled operators that increase cost, time, and product delivery. The low cost computer based automated system helps to get an edge by fulfilling these organizational demands. In this paper, an automated testing system has been developed to support functional testing of Nortel Network's modem system (1-Meg SUT). The modem is an inherently complex asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) product and its testing is far more complex than just verification of process faults. The complexity of ADSL system renders automated test system an important and imperative part of ADSL testing. The subject paper demonstrates the indispensable need of automated test system for ADSL testing and its advantages in providing a competitive edge for the organization.},

abstract={For a considerable number of software projects, the creation of effective test cases is hindered by design documentation that is either lacking, incomplete, or obsolete. The exploratory testing approach can serve as a sound method in such situations. However, the efficiency of this testing approach strongly depends on the method, the documentation of explored parts of a system, the organization and distribution of work among individual testers on a team, and the minimization of potential (very probable) duplicities in performed tests. In this paper, we present a framework for replacing and automating a portion of these tasks. A screen-flow-based model of the tested system is incrementally reconstructed during the exploratory testing process by tracking testers' activities. With additional metadata, the model serves for an automated navigation process for a tester. Compared with the exploratory testing approach, which is manually performed in two case studies, the proposed framework allows the testers to explore a greater extent of the tested system and enables greater detection of the defects present in the system. The results show that the time efficiency of the testing process improved with the framework support. This efficiency can be increased by team-based navigational strategies that are implemented within the proposed framework, which is documented by another case study presented in this paper.},

abstract={Test automation is facing a new challenge because tools, as well as having to provide conventional test functionalities, must be capable to interact with ever more heterogeneous complex systems under test (SUT). The number of existing software interfaces to access these systems is also a growing number. The problem cannot be analyzed only from a technical or engineering perspective; the economic perspective is as important. This paper presents a process to systematically implement gateways which support the communication between test tools and SUTs with a reduced cost. The proposed solution does not preclude any interface protocol at the SUT side. This process is supported using a generic architecture of a gateway defined on top of OSGi. Any test tool can communicate with the gateway through a unique defined interface. To communicate the gateway and the SUT, basically, the driver corresponding to the SUT software interface has to be loaded.},

abstract={This paper presents a highly flexible simulation platform catering to the easy and rapid evaluation of existing and future digital subscriber line (DSL) deployments as well as DSL modem performance prediction using practical modem implementations in a complex multi-segment environment. The paper outlines the methodology employed to architect and develop the core software, followed by a description of the performance prediction hooks for a variety of current and future DSL modem technologies. The graphical user interface (GUI) abstracting the core software for the user is described in terms of the various configuration options and the quick and easy graphical design of typical and complex deployment scenarios. The proposed simulator's calculations, notably theoretical SNR margin, maximum theoretical capacity and reach, plus performance evaluation using user-designed modem models, are also outlined. To support the accuracy of the new simulator, results for some example scenarios are presented and compared against other available simulators.},

abstract={Functional requirements must be tested to check if the system executes as the end user expects. Validation environments must be able to test multiple kinds of applications that belong to different domains and technologies. Since this wide validation spectrum is very difficult to cope with, validation environments are usually specialized in domains, programming languages, technologies, etc. However, it is possible to identify that the validation processes for different systems share a set of commonalities and variability points. This is a perfect framework to apply the software product line approach to develop domain specific validation environments for testing specific products. In this paper we present our experience of applying software product lines to support the variability of validation environments. We illustrate our product-line experience of developing two domain-specific validation environments for two different case studies: digital TV and slots machines.},

abstract={Diderot is a parallel domain-specific language forthe analysis and visualization of multidimensional scientific images, such as those produced by CT and MRI scanners. Diderot is designed to support algorithms that are based on differential tensor calculus and produces a higher-order mathematical model which allows direct manipulation of tensor fields. One of the main challenges of the Diderot implementation is bridging this semantic gap by effectively translating high-level mathematical notation of tensor calculus into efficient low-level code in the target language. A key question for a high-level language, such as Diderot, is how do we know that the implementation is correct. We have previously presented and defended a core set of rewriting rules, but the full translation from source to executable requires much more work. In this paper, we present DATm, Diderot's automated testing model to check the correctness of the core operations in the programming language. DATm can automatically create test programs, and predict what the outcome should be. We measure the accuracy of the computations written in the Diderot language, based on how accurately the output of the program represents the mathematical equivalent of the computations. This paper describes a model for testing a high-level language based on correctness. It introduces the pipeline for DATm, a tool that can automatically create and test tens of thousands of Diderot test programs and that has found numerous bugs. We make a case for the necessity of extensive testing by describing bugs that are deep in the compiler, and only could be found with a unique application of operations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the model can be used to create other types of tests by visual verification.},

abstract={This paper presents an empirical approach for microservice automated testing. With the rise of the agile methodology, automated testing has gained momentum in software development, including using microservices as an architectural style. However, the tests are not always related to the core specifications of the system being developed. In this paper, we discuss an approach to derive the tests, especially the acceptance tests, from the specifications of the systems. To avoid any ambiguity in the specifications, we focus on the formal specifications of the system. To this end, we introduce intelligent agents as a conceptual unit to encapsulate the formal specifications of services. Indeed, a comparison of microservice tenets and the general characterization of agents reveals that both can be thought of as autonomous software entities, driven by goals and evolving within a distributed environment and communicating with one another. Using a real-world application we show how agent formal specifications can be linked to microservice automated testing.},

abstract={Control functionality of modern rail vehicles is getting more and more complex. It contains several modules such as the traction control unit or the central control unit, as well as input and output stations, such as driver's cab terminals and process I/Os. A plethora of devices are connected to the vehicle and train bus and are able to communicate. The functions of the vehicle control and traction systems are configured by using function blocks from which loadable programs are generated. The languages used to program the control units are well established in the field. However, one-size-fits-all approach cannot adequately address the increased complexity of the software in modern trains. In this paper we describe our preliminary experience with using the multi-paradigm modeling tool �mbeddr� in the railway domain.

abstract={Game design and development activities are increasingly relying on the analysis of gamer's behavior and preferences data. Various tools are available to the developers to track and analyze general data concerning acquisition, retention and monetization aspects of game commercialization. This is good enough to give hints on where problems are, but not to enable a precise diagnosis, which demands fine-grained data. For this kind of data, there is not enough support or guidance to decide which data to capture, to write the code to capture it, to choose the best representation of it and to allow an adequate retrieval and presentation of it. This paper introduces GameGuts (GG), a framework devoted to give further assistance to developers in choosing, representing, accessing and presenting game sessions fine-grained data. As a case study, GG recorded sessions of a game platform with over a hundred thousand users. The logs were analyzed using a Visual Domain Specific Language (as a query language) and an ensemble of rules (as a compliance test). The results are encouraging, since we could - among other results - find bugs and catch cheaters, as well as spot design flaws.},

These rules are entirely authored, managed, tested and governed by Subject Matter Experts with no programming background. The Business Rules Architecture incorporates a componentized approach to authoring and organizing Business Rules which promotes extensive rule reuse at several levels through layered components. To mitigate complexity, the framework provides features for sandbox testing and regression testing of the rules by the Business Users. It also provides a rich reporting and trace ability back to the Policy charter. As a result of this framework a legacy adjudication COBOL program of 50,000+ lines were reduced to 30+ reusable rules. Nearly 94 % of the claims processed are automatically adjudicated by the rules engine.

abstract={Model-based mutation testing (MBMT) is a promising testing methodology that relies on a model of the system under test (SUT) to create test cases. Hence, MBMT is a so-called black-box testing approach. It also is fault based, as it creates test cases that are guaranteed to reveal certain faults: after inserting a fault into the model of the SUT, it looks for a test case revealing this fault. This turns MBMT into one of the most powerful and versatile test case generation approaches available as its tests are able to demonstrate the absence of certain faults, can achieve both, control-flow and data-flow coverage of model elements, and also may include information about the behaviour in the failure case. The latter becomes handy whenever the test execution framework is bound in the number of observations it can make and - as a consequence - has to restrict them. However, this versatility comes at a price: MBMT is computationally expensive. The tool MoMuT::UML (https://www.momut.org) is the result of a multi-year research effort to bring MBMT from the academic drawing board to industrial use. In this paper we present the current stable version, share the lessons learnt when applying two generations of MoMuT::UML in an industrial setting, and give an outlook on the upcoming, third,generation.},

abstract={The wide usage of hardware intellectual property (IP) cores from untrusted vendors has raised security concerns in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. Existing testing methods are designed to validate the functionality of the hardware IP cores. These methods often fall short in detecting unspecified (often malicious) logic. Formal methods like Proof-Carrying Hardware (PCH), on the other hand, can help eliminate hardware Trojans and/or design backdoors by formally proving security properties on soft IP cores despite the high proof development cost. One of the causes to the high cost is the manual conversion of the hardware design from RTL code to a domain-specific language prior to verification. To mitigate this issue and to lower the overall cost of PCH framework, we propose an automatic code converter for translating VHDL to Formal-HDL, a domain specific language for representing hardware designs in Coq language. Our code converter provides support to wide variety of hardware designs. Towards the goal of speeding up the verification procedure in our PCH framework, the code converter is the important first step. The applicability of the tool is demonstrated by converting soft IP cores of AES to its Coq equivalent code.},

year={2017},

pages={615-632}, 
abstract={Differential testing uses similar programs as cross-referencing oracles to find semantic bugs that do not exhibit explicit erroneous behaviors like crashes or assertion failures. Unfortunately, existing differential testing tools are domain-specific and inefficient, requiring large numbers of test inputs to find a single bug. In this paper, we address these issues by designing and implementing NEZHA, an efficient input-format-agnostic differential testing framework. The key insight behind NEZHA's design is that current tools generate inputs by simply borrowing techniques designed for finding crash or memory corruption bugs in individual programs (e.g., maximizing code coverage). By contrast, NEZHA exploits the behavioral asymmetries between multiple test programs to focus on inputs that are more likely to trigger semantic bugs. We introduce the notion of d-diversity, which summarizes the observed asymmetries between the behaviors of multiple test applications. Based on d-diversity, we design two efficient domain-independent input generation mechanisms for differential testing, one gray-box and one black-box. We demonstrate that both of these input generation schemes are significantly more efficient than existing tools at finding semantic bugs in real-world, complex software. NEZHA's average rate of finding differences is 52 times and 27 times higher than that of Frankencerts and Mucerts, two popular domain-specific differential testing tools that check SSL/TLS certificate validation implementations, respectively. Moreover, performing differential testing with NEZHA results in 6 times more semantic bugs per tested input, compared to adapting state-of-the-art general-purpose fuzzers like American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) to differential testing by running them on individual test programs for input generation. NEZHA discovered 778 unique, previously unknown discrepancies across a wide variety of applications (ELF and XZ parsers, PDF viewers and SSL/TLS libraries), many of which constitute previously unknown critical security vulnerabilities. In particular, we found two critical evasion attacks against ClamAV, allowing arbitrary malicious ELF/XZ files to evade detection. The discrepancies NEZHA found in the X.509 certificate validation implementations of the tested SSL/TLS libraries range from mishandling certain types of KeyUsage extensions, to incorrect acceptance of specially crafted expired certificates, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks. All of our reported vulnerabilities have been confirmed and fixed within a week from the date of reporting.},

abstract={Automated analysis and assessment of students' programs, typically implemented in automated program assessment systems (APASs), are very helpful to both students and instructors in modern day computer programming classes. The mainstream of APASs employs a black-box testing approach which compares students' program outputs with instructor-prepared outputs. A common weakness of existing APASs is their inflexibility and limited capability to deal with admissible output variants, that is, outputs produced by acceptable correct programs that differ from the instructor's. This paper proposes a more robust framework for automatically modelling and analysing student program output variations based on a novel hierarchical program output structure called HiPOS. Our framework assesses student programs by means of a set of matching rules tagged to the HiPOS, which produces a better verdict of correctness. We also demonstrate the capability of our framework by means of a pilot case study using real student programs.},

abstract={We present an approach to software framework development that includes the generation of domain-specific languages (DSLs) and pattern languages as goals for the process. Our model is made of three workflows-framework, metamodel, and patterns-and three phases-inception, construction, and formalization. The main conclusion is that when developing a framework, we can produce with minimal overhead-almost as a side effect-a metamodel with an associated DSL and a pattern language. Both outputs will not only help the framework evolve in the right direction, but will also be valuable in themselves. In order to illustrate these ideas, we present a case study in the multimedia domain. For several years, we have been developing a multimedia framework. The process has produced a full-fledged domain-specific metamodel for the multimedia domain, with an associated DSL and a pattern language.},

abstract={One of the most appealing feature for multi-application smart cards is their ability to dynamically download or delete applications once the card has been issued. Applications can be updated by deleting old versions and loading the new ones. Nevertheless, for system components, the update is sligthly more complex because the systems never stop. Indeed, for smart cards based on Java called JavaCard, the virtual machine has a life cycle similar to the card because persistent objects are preserved after the communication sessions with the reader have expired. We present in this paper, our research in dynamic system components updating of JavaCard. Our technique requires a lot of off-card and on-card mechanisms. Our approach uses control flow graph to determine change between versions, a domain specific language to represent the change for minimization of the download overhead throughout the communication link with the card.},

We propose a methodology for applying Test Driven Modelling in engineering of domains, requirements and software. We will restrict ourselves here to enterprise information systems and therefore to business domains. As common for Software Factories, domain models (as well as all other models) are software artefacts, not only documentation artefacts. In our approach Test Driven Modelling utilizes Test Driven Development for domain modelling. Domain models engineered in this way are used as Domain Specific Language for specifying software requirements. The hypothesis is that such domain models can be used for validation of requirements and verification of software, lead developments towards Software Factories, and increase dependability of software.},

abstract={Two fundamental principles and values of agile methods are customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software and the improvement of the communication process by continuous stakeholders' involvement. But, how to deal with customers' satisfaction and find a better visualization model at the requirements level (which stakeholders can understand and be involved) in an agile development context? Also, how this visualization model enhancement can guarantee consistency between agile requirements artefacts (e.g., user stories and domain models)? Thus, to answer these questions, this paper presents the SnapMind framework. This framework aims to make the requirements modelling process more user-centered, through the definition of a visual requirements language, based on mind maps, model-driven and domain specific language techniques. Moreover, through these techniques, the SnapMind framework focuses on support for consistency between user stories and the domain models using a model animation technique called snapshots. The framework was applied to an industrial case study to investigate its feasibility.},

abstract={This paper describes the evolution of a software testing effort during a critical period for the flagship Mars Science Laboratory rover project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Formal specification for post-run analysis of log files, using a domain-specific language, LogScope, replaced scripted real-time analysis. Log analysis addresses the key problems of on-the-fly approaches and cleanly separates specification and execution. Mining the test repository suggested the inadequacy of the scripted approach, and encouraged a partly engineer-driven development. LogScope development should hold insights for others facing the tight deadlines and reactionary nature of testing for critical projects. LogScope received a JPL Mariner Award for "improving productivity and quality of the MSL Flight Software" and has been discussed as an approach for other flight missions. We note LogScope features that most contributed to ease of adoption and effectiveness. LogScope is general and can be applied to any software producing logs.},

abstract={In this paper, the author explains a new approach of model based end-to-end chain testing using scenarios with original and simulated equipment. The first goal is to automatically derive test data and test cases from the model, which is defined by a domain specific language. Several solvers can be attached to the conversion to quickly create a wide variety of stimuli for the system(s) under test. Furthermore, the system under test can be stimulated by either original equipment - which is connected to the test bench - or the test bench can simulate equipment and create inputs for the tested systems. Any mixture of simulated and original equipment is possible and can be changed on the fly. In the end, the results from the system under test are collected. These results can then be displayed back in the model. This method is currently used and improved in the project "E-Cab" in which the author is involved. Passengers travelling by plane are in the focus of this project. Complete services and service chains - from the booking at home up to leaving the destination airport - are created and used by many systems communicating with each other. The author expects advantages from testing these end-to-end chains with this approach.},

year={2012},

pages={282-287}, 
abstract={Model executability is now a key concern in model-driven engineering, mainly to support early validation and verification (V&V). Some approaches allow to weave executability into metamodels, defining executable domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs). Model validation can then be achieved by simulation and graphical animation through direct interpretation of the conforming models. Other approaches address model executability by model compilation, allowing to reuse the virtual machines or V&V tools existing in the target domain. Nevertheless, systematic methods are currently not available to help the language designer in the definition of such an execution semantics and related tools. For instance, simulators are mostly hand-crafted in a tool specific manner for each DSML. In this paper, we propose to reify the elements commonly used to support state-based execution in a DSML. We infer a design pattern (called Executable DSML pattern) providing a general reusable solution for the expression of the executability concerns in DSMLs. It favors flexibility and improves reusability in the definition of semantics-based tools for DSMLs. We illustrate how this pattern can be applied to ease the development of V&V tools.},

pages={555-583}, 
abstract={Traceability has always been acknowledged as a relevant topic in Software Engineering. However, keeping track of the relationships between the different assets involved in a development process is a complex and tedious task. The fact that the main assets handled in any model-driven engineering project are models and model transformations eases the task. In order to take advantage of this scenario, which has not been appropriately capitalized on by the most widely adopted model transformation languages before, this work presents MeTAGeM-Trace, a methodological and technical proposal with which to support the model-driven development of model transformations that include trace generation. The underlying idea is to start from a high-level specification of the transformation which is subsequently refined into lower-level transformation models in terms of a set of DSLs until the source code that implements the transformation can be generated. Running this transformation produces not only the corresponding target models, but also a trace model between the elements of the source and target models. As part of the proposal, an EMF-based toolkit has been developed to support the development of ATL and ETL model transformations. This toolkit has been empirically validated by conducting a set of case studies following a systematic research methodology.},

abstract={High-performance FPGA programming has typically been the exclusive domain of a small band of specialized hardware developers. They are capable of reasoning about implementation concerns at the register-transfer level (RTL) which is analogous to assembly-level programming in software. Sometimes these developers are required to push further down to manage even lower levels of abstraction closer to physical aspects of the design such as detailed layout to meet critical design constraints. In contrast, software programmers have long since moved away from textual assembly-level programming towards relying on graphical integrated development environments (IDEs), high-level compilers, smart static analysis tools and runtime systems that optimize, manage and assist the program development tasks. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) can bridge this productivity gap by providing higher levels of abstraction in environments close to the domain of application expert. DSLs carefully limit the set of programming constructs to minimize programmer mistakes while also enabling a rich set of domain-specific optimizations and program transformations. With a large number of DSLs to choose from, an inexperienced FPGA user may be confused about how to select an appropriate one for the intended domain. In this paper, we review a combination of legacy and state-of-the-art DSLs available for FPGA development and provide a taxonomy and classification to guide selection and correct use of the framework.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an approach for the scenario-based testing of the core language models of domain-specific modeling languages (DSML). The core language model is a crucial artifact in DSML development, because it captures all relevant domain abstractions and specifies the relations between these abstractions. In software engineering, scenarios are used to explore and to define (actual or intended) system behavior as well as to specify user requirements. The different steps in a requirements-level scenario can then be refined through detailed scenarios. In our approach, we use scenarios as a primary design artifact. Non-executable, human-understandable scenario descriptions can be refined into executable test scenarios. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we implemented a scenario-based testing framework based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the Epsilon model-management toolkit.},

The main design skill is based on the cell-based digital IC design process, and is implemented in 0.18 �m 1P6M CMOS process. The main function of this chip is to build a bridge between Ethernet and ATM which is used to substitute for RISC processor, leading to enhance the broadband network switching ability and stability.

abstract={This paper focuses on Iran next generation network (NGN) Pilot, the purpose of which is to achieve appropriate knowledge for a desired move through current telecommunication network of Iran to NGN. On the base of this purpose, obtaining a proper knowledge about capabilities and weaknesses of vendors' NGN equipments is necessary as well as verifying the functionalities of these equipments in a multi-vendor environment. Accordingly, a test bed has been designed with the capability of executing various tests scenarios related to NGN and processing the results. At these stage two types of tests, i.e. Functional tests and Interoperability tests have been done. Since Functional tests are performed in a single-vendor environment; the proper interoperation among multi-vendor equipments can not be guaranteed. Consequently, other types of tests called Interoperability tests have been designed. These tests are performed in a multi-vendor environment and classified into two groups which process interoperation of two Call Servers or a Call Server and Gateway from different vendors, respectively. The following paper represents the results obtained from the mentioned tests as well as the precise assessment of them.},

Test automation, often relying on model based approaches, helps to reduce test time, however the introduction of related heavy weight processes is often quite challenging. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a bottom up testing approach, which in a nutshell, in the initial phase supports the integration tester in creating a semi-formal test case description and report. The approach, a textual domain specific framework, will guide the test expert in evolving the base language, in order to be tailored for a domain language of an organization. The evolved language can be linked to executable code, which enables in the long run (semi-)automated model based regression testing.},

The investigation is based on dynamics time domain simulations by DigSilent software and aims to define the main functions for the power management system (PMS) that will govern the operation of the power plant. In this paper, DigSilent Simulation Language (DSL) is used for simulation of Turbine-Governor and excitation system. Also DigSilent Program Language (DPL) is used to simulate action of PMS when it is required. Also, different dynamic contingencies related to Damavand power plant such as Trip of grid connection, Trip of One GT, Trip of load, Trip of Two GTs, Trip of Grid connection (According to governor logic, Automatic change mode acts, Solving frequency deviation by PMS) are considered. In each scenario, power plant stability is investigated and where required, PMS functions (such as load shedding and sending appropriate set points) are applied.},

Objective: The purpose of this systematic mapping study is to provide an overview of the empirical research in the area of software cloud-based testing, in order to build a classification scheme. We investigate functional and non-functional testing methods, the application of these methods, and the purpose of testing using these methods. Method: We searched for electronically available papers in order to find relevant literature and to extract and analyze data about the methods used. Result: We identified 69 primary studies reported in 75 research papers published in academic journals, conferences, and edited books. Conclusion: We found that only a minority of the studies combine rigorous statistical analysis with quantitative results. The majority of the considered studies present early results, using a single experiment to evaluate their proposed solution.},

abstract={The vision of service-oriented computing has been largely developed on the fundamental principle of building systems by composing and orchestrating services in their control flow. Nowadays, software development is notably influenced by service-oriented architectures (SOAs), in which the quality of software systems is determined by the quality of the involved services and their actual composition. Despite the efforts on improving their individual quality, adding or replacing services in an evolving system can introduce failures, thus compromising the satisfaction of the system's functional and extra-functional requirements. These failures erode the trust in the SOA vision. Thus, a key issue for the industrial adoption of SOA is providing service providers, integrators, and consumers the means to build confidence that services behave according to the contracted quality conditions. In this paper we present a first version of PA SCA NI, a framework for specifying and executing test specifications for service-oriented systems. From a test specification, PA SCA NI generates a configuration of testing services compliant with the Service Component Architecture (SCA) specification, which can be composed to integrate different testing strategies, being these tests traceable in an automated way. Our evaluation results show the applicability of the framework and a substantial gain in the tester's effort for developing tests.},

abstract={Domain-specific modelling (DSM) is a modern software development technology that aims at enhancing productivity. One of the claimed advantages of DSM is increased maintainability of software. However, current empirical evidence supporting this claim is lacking. In this paper, we contribute evidence from a case study conducted at a software development company. We study how the introduction of DSM affected the maintenance of a legacy system. We collected data about the maintenance phase of a system that was initially developed using manual programming, but which was gradually replaced by DSM development. We performed statistical analyses of the relation between the use of DSM and the time needed to resolve defects, the defect density, and the phase in which defects were detected. The results show that after introducing DSM the defect density is lower, that defects are found earlier, but resolving defects takes longer. Other observed benefits are that the number of developers and the number of person-hours needed for maintaining the system decreased, and the portability to new platforms increased. Our findings are useful for organizations that consider introducing DSM and would like to know which benefits can be realized in software maintenance.},

While the problem of packet parsing is solved, session parsing remains challenging. Building on existing systems that reliably parse individual messages, we present our four-component framework for implementing protocol session parsers with the goal to improve security of protocol parsing: specification of a protocol message, description of a protocol state machine, testing routines to validate implementations against fake and real data, and graph generation to visualize implementations. This framework enables the creation of a session parser, which validates individual protocol messages in the context of other messages in the same conversation. This is helpful because more secure parsers lead to more secure communication.},

abstract={The development of complex and highly safety-critical avionics systems, such as fly-by-wire, is typically linked with high efforts, risks and thus costs. Especially with regard to certification the testing activities during verification are playing a major role. This paper introduces the automatization complex of the testing artifact generation by use of Abstract State Machines (ASM), which allows a unified approach for system and software testing. The baseline is the Flexible Platform technology (a platform based development approach) currently under development by the Institute of Aircraft Systems (ILS) of the University of Stuttgart. The remaining automatization complex is the automated generation of certification relevant documentation, i.e. the requirements. These three complexes establish the AAA-Process which lays the foundation for an effective total system capability for complex avionics systems while simultaneously mitigating risks and costs. The actual test artifact generation is strictly aligned to development standards used in the aviation industry. Requirements exist as classes in a textual representation as well as in a specification model, represented by ASMs. The functional behavior, as described by the models, serves as a test oracle for test case generation. For this the model is translated into a graph system, instrumented by selectable testing methods and executed. The resulting trace data is used to automatically derive test procedures under consideration of the corresponding test environment as scripts, which are directly executable within our testing infrastructure consisting of a HiL simulation. Furthermore this includes the automatic generation of the associated traceability data and test specification documentation. An initial framework has been defined to support exchangeability of individual tasks in the generation tool-chain. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by testing the complete heterogeneous signal communication of an exemplary avionics system, resp. platform instance, at system level as well as at software high-level.},

abstract={In Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), the behaviour of the software to be built is specified as a set of example interactions with the system, expressed using a �Given-When-Then� structure. The examples are written using customer language, and are readable by end-users. They are also executable, and act as tests that determine whether the implementation matches the desired behaviour or not. This approach can be effective in building a common understanding of the requirements, but it can also face problems. When the suites of examples grow large, they can be difficult and expensive to change. Duplication can creep in, and can be challenging to detect manually. Current tools for detecting duplication in code are also not effective for BDD examples. Moreover, human concerns of readability and clarity can rise. We present an approach for detecting duplication in BDD suites that is based around dynamic tracing, and describe an evaluation based on three open source systems.},

abstract={This paper presents the updated results on research for development of a static switch for operation in medium voltage. It shows the results of the algorithm that detects an outage and enables the digital processing to control the static switch. This algorithm was based on the Clarke and Park transforms. The operation of the switch consists of transferring the power supply from the main source, where an outage occurred, to an alternative power source (backup). The load stays off for a time of milliseconds. A low voltage prototype was built, to allow the evaluation of the algorithm. Then a prototype of the static switch was built in voltage of 13,8kV. The first tests - feeding resistive load - are presented in voltage of 13.8 kV.},

abstract={Business processes are milestone of the information system of any companies. Their availability is a crucial aspect. We provide a solution for the high level of availability of business processes by the use of cluster of enterprise service buses (ESB). Our approach is based on the dynamic creation of the route between the business services and the migration of a runtime context from one ESB to another one. So, we insure the management of business processes over a cluster and measure the impact of such incident. Through the use of log, we also report these events which allow the administrator for preparing updates of the information system. With the use of open source software, we guarantee the reuse of our case study with other kinds of enterprise service bus, which respect open standard exchanges like XML language and REST API.},

pages={551-554}, 
abstract={Current continuous integration (CI) tools, although extensible, can be limiting in terms of flexibility. In particular, artifact analysis capabilities available through plug in mechanisms are both coarse-grained and centralized. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a new paradigm, Code Aware, for distributed and fine-grained artifact analysis. Code Aware is an ecosystem inspired by sensor networks, consisting of monitors and actuators, aimed at improving code quality and team productivity. Code ware's vision entails (a) the ability to probe software artifacts of any granularity and localization, from variables to classes or files to entire systems, (b) the ability to perform both static and dynamic analyses on these artifacts, and (c) the ability to describe targeted remediation actions, for example to notify interested developers, through automated actuators. We provide motivational examples for the use of Code Aware that leverage current CI solutions, sketch the architecture of its underlying ecosystem, and outline research challenges.},

abstract={Understanding the practical impact of mobility in a wireless network is essential for the wireless networks of tomorrow. Mobility influences the network performance, behavior, and ability to provide seamless service across a wide area. Testing and evaluating the real impact of mobility is difficult in the field with so many variables such as interference, fading, and so on. Experimental wireless evaluation in a test environment must correspond to an actual deployment. Furthermore, it is important to achieve repeatability without sacrificing realism. This study presents a functional test platform that uses real IEEE 802.11 equipment, providing repeatability and reliability. The platform is used to test the practical impact of device movement in a WLAN cell while voice and data applications are running. The mobility characteristics of wireless devices are based on individual models used by researchers with the addition of real aspects of mobility from empirical studies to improve realism.},

volume={},

pages={249-256}, 
abstract={Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is an "outside-in" approach to software development built upon semi-formal mediums for specifying the behaviour of a system as it would be observed externally. Through the representation of a system as a collection of user stories and scenarios using BDD's notation, practitioners automate acceptance tests using examples of desired behaviour for the envisioned system. A formal model created in concert with BDD tests would provide valuable insight into test validity and enhance the visibility of the problem domain. This work called BHive builds upon the formal underpinnings of BDD scenarios by mapping their "Given," "When," and "Then" statements to "Precondition," "Command," and "Postcondition" constructs as introduced by Floyd-Hoare logic. We posit that this mapping allows for a B-Method representation to be created and that such a model is useful for exploring system behaviour and exposing gaps in requirements. We also outline extensions to BDD tooling required for the described integration and present benefits of the BHive approach to integrating formalism within a BDD project.},

pages={356-367}, 
abstract={The core language model is a central artifact of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) as it captures all relevant domain abstractions and their relations. Natural-language scenarios are a means to capture requirements in a way that can be understood by technical as well as non-technical stakeholders. In this paper, we use scenarios for the testing of structural properties of DSML core language models. In our approach, domain experts and DSML engineers specify requirements via structured natural-language scenarios. These scenario descriptions are then automatically transformed into executable test scenarios providing forward and backward traceability of domain requirements. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we used Eclipse Xtext to implement a requirements language for the definition of semi-structured scenarios. Transformation specifications generate executable test scenarios that run in our test platform which is built on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Epsilon language family.},

abstract={Softwarization and cloudification of networks through software defined networking and network functions virtualisation promise a new degree of flexibility and agility. By moving logic from device firmware into software applications and applying software development mechanisms, innovation can be introduced with less effort. Concrete ways how to operate and orchestrate such systems are not yet defined. The process of making changes to a controller software or a virtualized network function in a production network without the risk of network disruption is not covered by literature. Complexity of systems brings the risk of unexpected side-effects and has so long been a show-stopper for administrators applying changes to networking devices. This paper suggests the adaption of the successful concept of continuous delivery into the software defined networking world. Test-driven development and automatic acceptance tests demonstrate that the software engineering community already found ways to ensure that changes do not break. Applied to network engineering, the adaption of continuous delivery can be seen as an enabler for risk-free and frequent changes in production infrastructure through push button deployments.},

abstract={In a development process where testing is highly automated, there is a major challenge to cope with issues such as huge test size and test stability. In this paper, we propose a model-based testing (MBT) tool called JCUnit, which generates a test suite from a model given as a Java class. Unlike other tools, it is designed to generate small and stable test suites and supports various popular models. With this tool, developers can apply MBT approach to their products without learning domain-specific language of proprietary MBT tools. Moreover, features such as portability and pluggability make it useful in a wide range of phases from unit testing to system testing. As a result, the efforts required in practical software testing will be reduced.},

To demonstrate the need for improvement and the framework developed, the authors have created different models that conform to the metamodel of a domain-specific language. Subsequently, the authors compared these models using the algorithms of the eclipse modelling framework (EMF) Compare tool, part of the eclipse modeling project, which is the framework of reference for MDE. Thus, in the case study, the authors tool is used to measure the quality of the comparisons performed by EMF Compare.},

pages={191-202}, 
abstract={Mainstream compilers contain a large number of peephole optimizations, which perform algebraic simplification of the input program with local rewriting of the code. These optimizations are a persistent source of bugs. Our recent research on Alive, a domain-specific language for expressing peephole optimizations in LLVM, addresses a part of the problem by automatically verifying the correctness of these optimizations and generating C++ code for use with LLVM. This paper identifies a class of non-termination bugs that arise when a suite of peephole optimizations is executed until a fixed point. An optimization can undo the effect of another optimization in the suite, which results in non-terminating compilation. This paper (1) proposes a methodology to detect non-termination bugs with a suite of peephole optimizations, (2) identifies the necessary condition to ensure termination while composing peephole optimizations, and (3) provides debugging support by generating concrete input programs that cause non-terminating compilation. We have discovered 184 optimization sequences, involving 38 optimizations, that cause non-terminating compilation in LLVM with Alive-generated C++ code.},

abstract={Over the last three years, Android has established itself as the largest-selling operating system for smartphones. It boasts of a Linux-based robust kernel, a modular framework with multiple components in each application, and a security-conscious design where each application is isolated in its own virtual machine. However, all of these desirable properties would be rendered ineffectual if an application were to deliver erroneous messages to targeted applications and thus cause the target to behave incorrectly. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of the robustness of Inter-component Communication (ICC) in Android through fuzz testing methodology, whereby, parameters of the inter-component communication are changed to various incorrect values. We show that not only exception handling is a rarity in Android applications, but also it is possible to crash the Android runtime from unprivileged user processes. Based on our observations, we highlight some of the critical design issues in Android ICC and suggest solutions to alleviate these problems.},

abstract={The single-channel dataports are a series of D4 channel units that convert the digital signal derived from one T-facility time slot by the D4 common circuits to an appropriate format at speeds of 64, 9.6, 4.8, or 2.4 kb/s for use in the Digital Data System (DDS). They come in two formats, the first being the DDS bipolar format for 64 kb/s and the second, for the remaining three speeds, being an EIA RS-449 format. Their error-correction feature ensures 10-8error-rate performance for a 10-3error-rate transmission channel. Advances in large-scale integration (LSI) technology have allowed the packaging of all the digital circuit functions needed into the space of a single channel unit. An on-board power converter unit generates the additional current required by the dataports over that needed by regular analog channel units. The local loop side of each channel unit uses integrated technology to achieve signal equalization and timing recovery. Standard DDS remote maintenance features are provided. The dataport channel units are easily installed and removed; they supply economical digital transmission.},

year={2013}, 
volume={},

pages={725-729}, 
abstract={Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) technology is used worldwide since it has simplified the installation and management of the devices. As a result, many devices are now equipped with UPnP capabilities. Unfortunately using UPnP in home routers puts routers at risk of abuse. For example, it is easier for hackers to discover the devices and use device vulnerabilities in order to make malicious attacks to cause financial or reputation damage to the users. In this paper, we have analyzed the UPnP protocol and its different vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we have emphasized how common the problem is with the home users' devices. Hence, we suggest a tool to achieve transparency in the health of the Internet by detecting UPnP enabled devices which are likely to be attacked on home networks. The tool will look for UPnP based attacks when people's routers have been compromised. The tool is easy to install and use for novice home users and maintains their privacy too. This project aims not only to implement a tool for a user to determine whether his/her system is vulnerable to a particular attack, but also to measure the prevalence of vulnerabilities at national or global level. Thus a larger framework is required to collect and manage the results from individual users.},

abstract={Product-line architectures (PLA)s are a paradigm for developing software families by customizing and composing reusable artifacts, rather than handcrafting software from scratch. Extensive testing is required to develop reliable PLAs. Each PLA may have hundreds of valid variants that can be constructed from the architecture's components. It is crucial that each of these variants be thoroughly tested to ensure the quality of these applications on multiple OS platforms and hardware configurations. Setting up test environments and running tests can become extremely complex and expensive as the number of variants and the complexity of their deployment and configuration increases. Once a variant is deemed ready for deployment and configuration in a production environment, it is crucial that these activities be done identically to the tested configurations and upholds the assumptions of the component developers. Rapidly setting up numerous distributed test environments and ensuring that they are deployed and configured correctly is hard. This poster paper presents FireAnt, which is a tool for the model-driven development (MDD) of PLA deployment plans},

abstract={A basic premise of model driven development (MDD) is to capture all important design information in a set of formal or semi-formal models which are then automatically kept consistent by tools. The concept however is still relatively immature and there is little by way of empirically validated guidelines. In this paper we report on the use of MDD on a significant real-world project over several years. Our research found the MDD approach to be deficient in terms of modelling architectural design rules. Furthermore, the current body of literature does not offer a satisfactory solution as to how architectural design rules should be modelled. As a result developers have to rely on time-consuming and error-prone manual practices to keep a system consistent with its architecture. To realise the full benefits of MDD it is important to find ways of formalizing architectural design rules which then allow automatic enforcement of the architecture on the system model. Without this, architectural enforcement will remain a bottleneck in large MDD projects.},

A waypoint is a semantic Web that leverages these approaches, along with those offered by an environment more capable of managing first-class data directly. This is only one path, however, and it probably isn't the shortest. The Internet is a rich environment with billions of active agents. Natural selection, mutation, and genetic breeding of sorts all happen to software systems, together with a significantly higher proportion of "intelligent design" than found in the real world.

Our ontology has been actively integrated with the common-used control framework. The ontology also provides service abstraction between service providers and users, which defines generalized resource request for users to describe the desired resources on different test beds. It has been shown to be useful for describing heterogeneous networked sensing substrate and be feasible for allocating resources across various test beds.},

abstract={The creation, execution, and maintenance of tests are some of the most expensive tasks in software development. To help reduce the cost, automated test generation tools can be used to assist and guide developers in creating test cases. Yet, the tests that automated tools produce range from simple skeletons to fully executable test suites, hence their complexity and quality vary. This paper compares the complexity and quality of test suites created by sophisticated automated test generation tools to that of developer-written test suites. The empirical study in this paper examines ten real-world programs with existing test suites and applies two state-of-the-art automated test generation tools. The study measures the resulting test suite quality in terms of code coverage and fault-finding capability. On average, manual tests covered 31.5% of the branches while the automated tools covered 31.8% of the branches. In terms of mutation score, the tests generated by automated tools had an average mutation score of 39.8% compared to the average mutation score of 42.1% for manually written tests. Even though automatically created tests often contain more lines of source code than those written by developers, this paper's empirical results reveal that test generation tools can provide value by creating high quality test suites while reducing the cost and effort needed for testing.},

Understanding how these processes interact and how they are aligned with other while they should support the tasks involved in the conception of a new vehicle at a minimum time and cost. The first step to achieve this goal is the definition of a new UML profile (called VDML, vehicle development modeling language) based on the extension mechanics of UML (industry standard language) to assist business process description and consequent improvements achieved by the high level vision.

abstract={Over the last few years, technologies for the formal description, construction, analysis, and validation of software - based mostly on logics and formal reasoning - have matured. We can expect them to complement and partly replace traditional software engineering methods in the future. Formal methods in software engineering are an increasingly important application area for intelligent systems. The field has outgrown the area of academic case studies, and industry is showing serious interest. We convincingly argue that we've reached the point where we can solve the problem of how to formally verify industrial-scale software. We propose program verification as a computer science Grand Challenge. Deductive software verification is a core technology of formal methods. We describe recent dramatic changes in the way it's perceived and used. Another important base technique of formal methods, besides software verification, is synthesizing software that's correct by construction because it's formally derived from its specification. We discuss recent developments and trends in this area. Surprisingly efficient decision procedures for the satisfiability modulo theories problem have recently emerged. We explain these techniques and why they're important for all formal-methods tools. We look at formal methods from an industry perspective. We explain the success of Microsoft Research's SLAM project, which has developed a verification tool for device drivers},

abstract={To meet end-user performance expectations, precise performance requirements are needed during development and testing, e.g., to conduct detailed performance and load tests. However, in practice, several factors complicate performance requirements elicitation: lacking skills in performance requirements engineering, outdated or unavailable functional specifications and architecture models, the specification of the system's context, lack of experience to collect good performance requirements in an industrial setting with very limited time, etc. From the small set of available non-functional requirements engineering methods, no method exists that alone leads to precise and complete performance requirements with feasible effort and which has been reported to work in an industrial setting. In this paper, we present our experiences in combining existing requirements engineering methods into a performance requirements method called PROPRE. It has been designed to require no up-to-date system documentation and to be applicable with limited time and effort.

abstract={Mobile compatibility testing has been identified as one urgent and challenging issue. Mobile apps are expected to work on thousand kinds of mobile devices with diverse device features and mobile platforms. So mobile compatibility testing is complex and costly, it is impossible to test mobile apps on all mobile devices and in all environments with limited test resources. Then the question is how to select test devices in cost-effective mobile app compatibility testing. This paper proposes a novel test device selection approach using multi-objective genetic algorithm. Using the proposed approach, the minimum number of mobile devices is selected, and the multiple test coverage requirements are met simultaneously. Furthermore, the case study results have successfully demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective for mobile compatibility testing.},

abstract={Software's importance in the development of embedded systems has been growing rapidly over the last 20 years. Because of current embedded systems' complexity, they require sophisticated engineering methods for systematically developing high-quality software. Embedded software development differs from IT system development in several ways. For example, IT systems developers can use standard hardware and software platforms and don't face the resource requirements that embedded systems developers must take into account. To meet embedded software's extrafunctional requirements, embedded systems development is shifting from programming to model-driven development. Another important trend is the emphasis on the quality assurance of safety-related systems.},

abstract={DevOps is extended from certain agile practices with a mix of patterns intended to improve collaboration between development and operation teams. The main purpose of this paper is to conduct a study on how DevOps practice has impacted to software quality. The secondary objective is to find how to improve quality efficiently. A literature survey has carried out to explore about current DevOps practices in industry. According to the literature survey, the conceptual research model was developed and five hypotheses were derived. Research objectives were accomplished by testing hypotheses using Pearson correlation. A linear model is derived based on the linear regression analysis. An online questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data whereas interviews with experts on DevOps and Quality assurance have been used to identify how to improve the quality of software by practicing DevOps. Recommendations are given based on interview feedback, hypotheses testing with regression analysis. According to the quantitative study, researchers have identified that quality of the software gets improved when practice DevOps by following CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing) framework. Automation is the most critical factor to improve the software quality. As per the results of multiple regression analysis, it has proved culture, automation, measurement and sharing are important factors to consider to improve quality of the software. In conclusion it can be recommended to use DevOps to achieve high quality software.},

abstract={In engineering a service, software developers often construct and deploy a newer (forthcoming) version of the service to replace the current version. A forthcoming version is often placed online for users to consume and report feedback. In the case of observed failures, the forthcoming version should be debugged and further evolved. In this paper, we propose the model of dual-service fault localization (DFL) to aid this evolution process. Many prior research studies on spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) consider each version separately. The DFL model correlates the dynamic execution spectra of the current and the forthcoming versions of the same service placed for live test of the forthcoming version, and dynamically generates an adaptive fault localization formula to estimate the code regions in the forthcoming service responsible for the observed failures. We report an experiment in which we initialized the DFL model into six instances, each using an ensemble technique dynamically composed from 11 existing SBFL formulas, and applied the model to four benchmarks. The results show that DFL is feasible and multiple instances are statistically more effective than, if not as effective as, the best of these individual SBFL formulas on each benchmark.},

abstract={The six-day Remote Agent Experiment (RAX) on the Deep Space 1 mission will be the first time that an artificially intelligent agent will control a NASA spacecraft. Successful completion of this experiment will open the way for AI-based autonomy technology on future missions. An important validation objective for RAX is implementation of a credible validation and verification strategy for RAX that also "scales up" to missions that make full use of spacecraft autonomy. Autonomous flight software presents novel and difficult testing challenges that traditional flight software (FSW) does not face. Since autonomous software must respond robustly in an immense number of situations, the all-paths testing approaches used for traditional FSW is not feasible. Instead, we advocate a combination of scenario-based testing and model-based validation. This paper describes the testing challenges faced by autonomous spacecraft commanding software, discusses the testing strategies and model-validation methods that we found effective for RAX, and argues that these methods will "scale up" to missions that make full use of spacecraft autonomy. Among the key challenges for validating autonomous systems such as the RAX are ensuring adequate coverage for scenario-based tests, developing methods for specifying the expected behavior, and developing automated tools for verifying the observed behavior against those specifications. Another challenge, also faced by traditional FSW, is the scarcity of high-fidelity test-beds. The test plan must be designed to take advantage of lower-fidelity test-beds without compromising test effectiveness.},

abstract={Deep Space 1 is the first interplanetary spacecraft to use an ion propulsion system for the primary delta-v maneuvers. The purpose of the mission is to validate a number of technologies, including ion propulsion and a high degree of spacecraft autonomy, on a flyby of an asteroid and two comets. The ion propulsion system has operated for a total of 3500 hours at engine power levels ranging from 0.48 to 1.94 kW and has completed the encounter with the asteroid 1992KD and the first set of deterministic burns required for a 2001 encounter with comet Wilson-Harrington. The system has worked extremely well after an initial grid short was cleared after launch. Operation during this primary mission phase has demonstrated all ion propulsion system and autonomous navigation functions. All propulsion system operating parameters are very close to the expected values with the exception of the thrust at higher power levels, which is about 2 percent lower than that calculated from the electrical parameters. This paper provides an overview of the system and presents the first flight validation data on an ion propulsion system in interplanetary space.},

abstract={For the purpose of security of the computer systems, organizations now a days plan a lot of things like firewalls, network scanning tools, secure sockets layer (SSL) etc. However security bugs present at the application layer (code level) caused by unawareness or mistakes of the developers are usually ignored. Such security bugs can lead to unauthorized privileges on a computer system. For example most web applications connect back to databases which contain sensitive information. Malicious input can allow the attacker to alter the flow of the web application and provide unauthorized access to the confidential database. Hence proper security tests are required to be conducted in order to assess the security of applications. In this paper, we propose the use of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) for the purpose of security testing of Java applications. With the examples of fuzz testing and servlet testing using aspects, we will show how AOP can be used for detection of security bugs in Java applications by creeping inside the program without making any changes to the source code.},

abstract={We tackle the problem of analyzing filter and sanitizer programs remotely, i.e. given only the ability to query the targeted program and observe the output. We focus on two important and widely used program classes: regular expression (RE) filters and string sanitizers. We demonstrate that existing tools from machine learning that are available for analyzing RE filters, namely automata learning algorithms, require a very large number of queries in order to infer real life RE filters. Motivated by this, we develop the first algorithm that infers symbolic representations of automata in the standard membership/equivalence query model. We show that our algorithm provides an improvement of x15 times in the number of queries required to learn real life XSS and SQL filters of popular web application firewall systems such as mod-security and PHPIDS. % Active learning algorithms require the usage of an equivalence oracle, i.e. an oracle that tests the equivalence of a hypothesis with the target machine. We show that when the goal is to audit a target filter with respect to a set of attack strings from a context free grammar, i.e. find an attack or infer that none exists, we can use the attack grammar to implement the equivalence oracle with a single query to the filter. Our construction finds on average 90% of the target filter states when no attack exists and is very effective in finding attacks when they are present. For the case of string sanitizers, we show that existing algorithms for inferring sanitizers modelled as Mealy Machines are not only inefficient, but lack the expressive power to be able to infer real life sanitizers. We design two novel extensions to existing algorithms that allow one to infer sanitizers represented as single-valued transducers. Our algorithms are able to infer many common sanitizer functions such as HTML encoders and decoders. Furthermore, we design an algorithm to convert the inferred models into BEK programs, which allows for further applications such as cross checking different sanitizer implementations and cross compiling sanitizers into different languages supported by the BEK backend. We showcase the power of our techniques by utilizing our black-box inference algorithms to perform an equivalence checking between different HTML encoders including the encoders from Twitter, Facebook and Microsoft Outlook email, for which no implementation is publicly available.},

One specific scenario is Internet access from moving vehicles on the road as we are researching in the drive-thru Internet project. Using wireless LAN as a broadly available access technology leads to intermittent - largely unpredictable and usually short-lived - connectivity, yet providing high performance while available. To allow Internet applications to deal reasonably well with such intermittent connectivity patterns, we have introduced a supportive drive-thru architecture. A key component is a "session" protocol offering persistent end-to-end communications even in the presence of interruptions. In this paper, we present the design of the persistent connectivity management protocol (PCMP) and report on findings from our implementation.},

abstract={The speed of development of the IT industry as well as the computational power which are increasing exponentially, create great competitiveness in the process of development but also in the launching of software products on the market. Automated testing comes to help with these challenges by trying to increase the speed of development by offering fast feedback and trustworthy quality by means of repeated runs of the implemented tests. This isn't a problem just on a technical level, but also on a social level, especially in the area of communication and understanding the requirements of the client. This work presents the implementation of an automated testing framework which also addresses the social problems. BDD or �Behavior Driven Development� includes an approach which would like to line up the area of client requests to the technical area, offering a uniform platform of collaboration and development. The implementation of this principle is applied in an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) type project which is meant to demonstrate the technical solution which may draw together, both socially and communication wise, the business teams and the technical implementation teams.},

abstract={The significant expansion of autonomous control and information processing capabilities in the coming generation of mission software systems results in a qualitatively larger space of behaviors that needs to be "covered" during testing, not only at the system level but also at subsystem and unit levels. A major challenge in this area is to automatically generate a relatively small set of test cases that, collectively, guarantees a selected degree of coverage of the behavior space. This paper describes an algorithm for a parametric test case generation tool that applies a combinatorial design approach to the selection of candidate test cases. Evaluation of this algorithm on test parameters from the Deep Space One mission reveals a valuable reduction in the number of test cases, when compared to an earlier home-brewed generator.},

abstract={One of the surprising observations of traceability in practice is the under-utilization of existing trace links. Organizations often create links in order to meet compliance requirements, but then fail to capitalize on the potential benefits of those links to provide support for activities such as impact analysis, test regression selection, and coverage analysis. One of the major adoption barriers is caused by the lack of accessibility to the underlying trace data and the lack of skills many project stakeholders have for formulating complex trace queries. To address these challenges we introduce TiQi, a natural language approach, which allows users to write or speak trace queries in their own words. TiQi includes a vocabulary and associated grammar learned from analyzing NL queries collected from trace practitioners. It is evaluated against trace queries gathered from trace practitioners for two different project environments.},

One of the greatest challenges to being able to achieve this abstraction at the OS level has been the requirement to communicate and manage many different sets of vendor technologies. The main inhibitor to overcoming this challenge has been the lack of standards supporting both the interface from an OS to an EMS and also that between OSs. Building upon the successful multi technology network management (MTNM) CORBA/IDL interface, MTOSI has extended MTNM work to support XML/Web service interactions between various types of operations systems. MTOSI bridged the standard gap by defining a methodology and a framework to map the domain specific business activities into well defined TMF NGOSS contracts according to the service oriented architecture principles. This session introduces the key aspects of MTOSI and presents a real use case of MTOSI in BT},

abstract={We all want to be associated with long lasting ideas; as originators, or at least, expositors. For a tyro researcher or a seasoned veteran, knowing how long an idea will remain interesting in the community is critical in choosing and pursuing research threads. In the physical sciences, the notion of half-life is often evoked to quantify decaying intensity. In this paper, we study a corpus of 19,000+ papers written by 21,000+ authors across 16 software engineering publication venues from 1975 to 2010, to empirically determine the half-life of software engineering research topics. In the absence of any consistent and well-accepted methodology for associating research topics to a publication, we have used natural language processing techniques to semi-automatically identify and associate a set of topics with a paper. We adapted measures of half-life already existing in the bibliometric context for our study, and also defined a new measure based on publication and citation counts. We find evidence that some of the identified research topics show a mean half-life of close to 15 years, and there are topics with sustaining interest in the community. We report the methodology of our study in this paper, as well as the implications and utility of our results.},

abstract={Testing a computer system is a challenging task, both due to the large number of possible test cases and the limited resources allocated for testing activities. This means that only a subset of all possible test cases can be chosen to test a system, and therefore the decision on the selection of test cases becomes important. The result of static analysis of a system can be used to help with this decision, in the context of model-based development of systems, this means that the analysis performed on a system model can be used to prioritize and guide the testing efforts. Furthermore, since models allow expression of non-functional requirements (such as performance, timing and security), model-guided testing can be used to direct testing towards specific parts of the system which have large impact on such requirements. In this paper, we focus on modeling and trade-off analysis of non-functional requirements and how static analysis helps to identify problematic parts of a system and thus guide the selection of test cases to target such parts.},

abstract={Model-based testing (MBT) provides a systematic and automated way to facilitate rigorous testing of software systems. MBT has been an intense area of research and a large number of MBT techniques have been developed in the literature and in the practice. However, all of the techniques have been developed using their own concepts and terminology of MBT, which are very often different than other techniques and at times have conflicting semantics. Moreover, while working on MBT projects with our industrial partners in the last several years, we were unable to find a unified way of defining MBT techniques based on standard terminology. To precisely define MBT concepts with the aim of providing common understanding of MBT terminology across techniques, we formalize a small subset of the recently released ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Software Testing Standard as a conceptual model (UML class diagrams) together with OCL constraints. The conceptual model captures all the necessary concepts based on the standard terminology that are mandatory or optional in the context of MBT techniques and can be used to define new MBT tools and techniques. To validate the conceptual model, we instantiated its concepts for various MBT techniques previously developed in the context of our industrial partners. Such instantiation automatically enforces the specified OCL constraints. This type of validation provided us feedback to further refine the conceptual model. Finally, we also provide our experiences and lessons learnt for such formalization and validation.},

abstract={Conventional wisdom on model transformations in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) suggests that they are crucial components in modeling environments to achieve superior automation, whether it be refactoring, simulation, or code generation. While their relevance is well-accepted, model transformations are challenging to design, implement, and verify because of the inherent complexity that they must encode. Thus, defining transformations by chaining existing ones is key to success for enhancing their reusability. This paper proposes an approach, based on well-established algorithms, to support modellers when multiple transformation chains are available to bridge a source metamodel with a target one. The all-important goal of selecting the optimal chain has been based on the quality criteria of coverage and information loss. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated by means of experiments operated on chains obtained from transformations borrowed from a publicly available repository.},

Some of these techniques are being used to solve several complex problems, such as the team allocation, building products portfolios in a software product line and test case selection/prioritization. However, despite the usefulness of these applications, the development of solutions based in CI techniques is not a trivial activity, since it involves the implementation/adaptation of algorithms to specific context and problems. This work presents Athena, a visual tool developed aiming at offering a simple approach to develop CI-based software systems. In order to do this, we proposed a drag-and-drop approach, which we called CI as a Service (CIaaS). Based on a preliminary study, we can state that Athena can help researchers to save time during the development of computational intelligence approaches.},

abstract={Avionics systems integration is an inherently complex undertaking. In addition to ensuring that basic functionality is satisfied, the systems integrator must maximize the systempsilas flexibility and reliability while minimizing weight and cost of change. With the introduction of integrated modular architectures (IMA) based on open standards, many traditional integration issues have been greatly improved. However, additional integration responsibilities arise due to having a large number of functions developed by independent suppliers all sharing the same physical resources. This paper describes the benefits of incorporating model-driven methodologies and associated tools into the systems integration process through Model Driven Integration (MDI). It describes how a system model can not only streamline the additional responsibilities but also establish a highly productive systems development environment and allow for virtual integration. In addition, this paper discusses a number of side- benefits that grow out of having a modeling tool platform such as enhanced team communication and automation opportunities. The analysis of avionics architectures and the use of model-driven methodologies to increase IMA manageability is based upon the authors' experience in developing platform computing systems at GE Aviation. GE Aviation has developed open system IMA architectures for both commercial aircraft and military aircraft.},

abstract={Software testing is a process to determine that a software product satisfies the specified requirements. Software testing spans over all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle namely, requirement specification, analysis, designing, development, deployment and maintenance of a software. Software testing is important to point out the defects in the software and to ensure that the developed software works fine in the real environment with different operating systems, devices, browsers and concurrent users. Further software testing can be classified into various types based on the objective of testing, level at which the testing is performed, knowledge of the system or the degree of automation. In this paper, we examine the suitability of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) for the purpose of performing various types of software testing. AOP is a programming paradigm which modularizes the crosscutting concerns into units called aspects and separates them from the modules implementing the primary business logic. This leads to a system that is easier to understand and simpler to maintain. The basis of the idea behind using AOP for software testing is that aspects in AOP can be used to capture execution points within the program's modules and thus we can test components where we suspect bugs without even modifying the source code.},

abstract={System quality assurance techniques like testing are important for high-quality products and processes. The effort for applying them is usually high, but can be reduced using automation. Automated test design is possible by using models to specify test-relevant aspects and by generating tests on this basis. Testing multiple variants of a system like, e.g., a product line of a German car manufacturer, results in a significant, additional effort. In this paper, we deal with model-based testing of product lines. We combine feature models that are used to describe product lines and models that are used for automated model-based test design. Our main contribution is the definition of a test generation approach on the product line level, i.e., that does not depend on resolving single product variants. Furthermore, we compare our approach to other test generation approaches and evaluate it using our tool chain SPLTestbench for some product line examples.},

abstract={Many embedded and distributed applications are based on processing nodes that perform parallel processing tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to evaluate the overall behaviour of this kind of applications because the overall behaviour consists of 1) the execution-paths of asynchronous processing nodes and of 2) messages that either activate or deactivate processing nodes to perform parallel processing tasks. In order to facilitate behaviour and reliability evaluation of applications doing parallel processing, we developed a method that: 1) is capable of composing an overall representation for parallel behaviours and recognizing both the defined use cases and undetermined behaviours from this representation and 2) supports calculation of use case-specific reliability values for components. In this paper, we describe the method, present a ComponentBee tool that implements the method and supports behaviour and reliability evaluation of multithreaded Java applications, and finally demonstrate the use of the method with a case study.},

abstract={A large number of mature software companies use data and analytic for status monitoring of their projects and to help improve their decision making at different levels within the organization. Dashboards or scorecards also provide common platform for different stakeholders to access information they need for tracking the status of projects of their interest. Further data from software issues database can provide real and observable indicators to track the quality of given product during its development and testing. The study presented here reports on distinct and evolution of information needs of different stakeholder groups interested in tracking such data. The action research report documents the evolution of software issues scorecard as it is extended to meet information need of specific user groups. A roadmap for future into how such scorecard can be made more effective is also presented.},

abstract={To produce a marketable PowerPC� microprocessor on a short development schedule, the logic had to be designed in a manner flexible enough to allow quick modifications without sacrificing high performance and density when customized cells were required. This was accomplished for the PowerPC 601� microprocessor (601) with a high-level design-language description, which was synthesized for a gate-level implementation and simulated for functional verification. In a similar way, the physical design strategy for the 601 struck an attractive balance between a highly automated, flexible floorplan and the additional density that had to be available for limited, well-conceived manual placements. Finally, a rigorous test strategy was implemented, which has proved very useful in analyzing the processor and in assembling 601-based systems. Careful adherence to this methodology led to a successful first-pass physical implementation, leaving the second iteration for additional customer requests.},

abstract={Quality of software has always been a problem in every area of software use. Lack of software can cause problems during software execution and lead to different failures. Measurement and control systems (MCS) are such a group of software which use laboratory devices to obtain measurement data or to control e.g. production processes. Bugs in software can lead to variety of problems, from incorrect measurement data to device damages. For this reason it is important to deliver software of good quality. Software development should be considered a process which consists of a sequence of steps and is supported by a tool or set of tools that interoperate to make the work with the software easier. The problem is that there is no such approach nor tools for MCS systems. For this reason, a suitable method of design and validation of this group of systems has been developed. Moreover, the proper solution for supporting the proposed method has been implemented and tested. The solution consists of Business Rule Management System (BMRS) used for validating software execution data in an efficient way.},

year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={2280-2286}, 
abstract={Context: Recently, test protocols from organizations like European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP) were extended to also cover active safety systems. Objective: The official EuroNCAP test protocol for Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)/Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems explicitly defines to what extent a Vehicle-Under-Test (VUT) is allowed to vary in its lateral position. In addition, the United States New Car Assessment Programme (US NCAP) test protocol has broader tolerance ranges. The goal for automotive OEMs is to understand the impact of such allowed variations on a the overall vehicle's performance. Method: A simulation-based approach is outlined that allows systematic, large-scale analysis of such influences to effectively plan time-consuming and resource-intense real-world vehicle tests. Our models allow a profound analysis of an AEB algorithm by modeling and conducting more than 3,000 simulation runs with EuroNCAP's dynamic CCRm and CCRb scenarios including those with adopted USNCAP parameters. Results: Our structured analysis of such test procedures involving dynamic actors is the first of its kind in a relevant industrial setting. Several anomalies were unveiled under US NCAP conditions to support real-world test runs. Hence, we could show that the proposed method supports all possible scenarios in AEB consumer tests and scales as we had to timely process approx. 7.7GB of simulation data. Conclusion: To achieve the expected performance and to study a system's behavior in potential misuse cases from a functional point of view, large scale, model-based simulations complement traditional testing on proving ground.},

abstract={Software engineering comprehends several disciplines devoted to prevent and remedy malfunctions and to warrant adequate behaviour. Testing, the subject of this paper, is a widespread validation approach in industry, but it is still largely ad hoc, expensive, and unpredictably effective. Indeed, software testing is a broad term encompassing a variety of activities along the development cycle and beyond, aimed at different goals. Hence, software testing research faces a collection of challenges. A consistent roadmap of the most relevant challenges to be addressed is here proposed. In it, the starting point is constituted by some important past achievements, while the destination consists of four identified goals to which research ultimately tends, but which remain as unreachable as dreams. The routes from the achievements to the dreams are paved by the outstanding research challenges, which are discussed in the paper along with interesting ongoing work.},

We conducted a systematic literature review on this topic with the aim to answer three research questions. We focus on various solutions developed for model-driven reverse engineering, outlining in particular the models they use and the transformations applied to the models. We also consider the tools used for model definition, extraction, and transformation and the level of automation reached by the available tools. The model-driven reverse engineering approaches are also analyzed based on various features such as genericity, extensibility, automation of the reverse engineering process, and coverage of the full or partial source artifacts. We describe in detail and compare fifteen approaches applying model-driven reverse engineering. Based on this analysis, we identify and indicate some hints on choosing a model-driven reverse engineering approach from the available ones, and we outline open issues concerning the model-driven reverse engineering approaches.},

abstract={Model slicers are tools which provide two services: (a) finding parts of interest in a model and (b) displaying these parts somehow or extract these parts as a new, autonomous model, which is referred to as slice or sub-model. This paper focuses on the creation of editable slices, which can be processed by model editors, analysis tools, model management tools etc. Slices are useful if, e.g., only a part of a large model shall be analyzed, compared or processed by time-consuming algorithms, or if sub-models shall be modified independently. We present a new generic incremental slicer which can slice models of arbitrary type and which creates slices which are consistent in the sense that they are editable by standard editors. It is built on top of a model differencing framework and does not require additional configuration data beyond those available in the differencing framework. The slicer can incrementally extend or reduce an existing slice if model elements shall be added or removed, even if the slice has been edited meanwhile. We demonstrate the usefulness of our slicer in several scenarios using a large UML model. A screencast of the demonstrated scenarios is provided at http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/projects/SiLift/ase2017.},

abstract={Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are established practices in modern agile software development. The DevOps movement adapted theses practices and places the deployment pipeline at its heart as one of the main requirements to automate the software development process and to deliver and operate software in a more robust way with higher quality. Over the time a lot of systems and tools has been developed to implement the deployment pipeline and to support continuous delivery. But software development is complex, its process even more and due to the individual organization of software vendors no real all-in-one solution for CD exists. Literature identified a lot of challenges when adopting CD and DevOps in an organization. This paper presents a conceptual model and fundamental design decisions for a new generation of software delivery systems tackling some of these issues. Our approach focuses on two specific challenges for adopting CD. The first is the lack of flexibility and maintainability of software delivery systems. The second is the insufficient user support to model and manage delivery processes and pipelines. We introduce an automated mechanism to ease the effort for developers and other stakeholders. Based on these results this paper introduces an architectural proposal for a next-generation continuous software delivery system."},

Thus, evolving software product lines must consider the impact that changes to requirements may have on the existing systems and their safety. The contribution of this work is a systematic, tool-supported technique to support safe evolution of product-line requirements using a model-based approach. We show how the potential feature interactions that need to be modeled are scoped and identified with the aid of product-line software fault tree analysis. Further, we show how reuse of the state-based models is effectively exploited in the evolution phase of product-line engineering. To illustrate this approach, we apply our technique to the evolution of a safety-critical cardiac pacemaker product line},

abstract={In order to incorporate the effect of test coverage, two novel software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are proposed in this paper using failure data and test coverage simultaneously. One is continuous using testing time, and the other is discrete with respect to the number of executed test cases instead of testing time. Since one of the most important factors of the coverage-based SRGMs is the test coverage function (TCF), we first discuss a discrete TCF based on Beta function. Then we develop mean value functions (MVF) of the two models integrating test coverage and imperfect debugging. Finally the proposed TCF and MVFs are evaluated and validated on actual software reliability data collected from real software development projects. The results demonstrate clearly that both the proposed TCF and SRGMs provide better estimation and fitting for the data sets under comparisons.},

Systems engineering efforts for distributed simulation environments are typically based on the middleware transport used, the applications available and the constraints placed on the technical team including network, computer and personnel limitations. To facilitate community re-use, systems engineering should focus on integrated operational function decomposition. This links data elements produced within the simulation to the functional capabilities required by the user. The system design should be captured at a functional level and subsequently linked to the technical design. Doing this within a data-driven systems engineering infrastructure allows generative programming techniques to assist accurate, flexible and rapid architecture development.

pages={265-271}, 
abstract={Thermal tools provide temperature margining capability by varying the case temperature at silicon thermal design power (TDP). They are used for process, voltage, temperature and frequency (PVTF) testing by Intel's post-silicon validation customers across servers, desktops, mobile and graphics segments. Thermal margining tools are widely used in silicon debug validation by varying the case temperature over a wide operating range of specifications of the Silicon to i) validate the silicon, ii) accelerate fault detection, and iii) reduce escapes and identify bugs. Thermal tool is controlled by a thermal controller to provide a temperature set-point based on the device under test's (DUT's) case or junction diode temperature. Air cooled thermal tool (AC-TT) employs a controller card to achieve the margining capability by running the tool's thermoelectric cooler (TEC), a Peltier device, within the optimal temperature range. AC-TT has an active heat sink design to remove the heat dissipated by the TEC and the silicon. Although AC-TT is expected to provide narrower range of margining capability due to the limitations of air cooling, they still can be an excellent solution for some specific thermal margining applications. Therefore, a new line of AC-TTs were developed for validation customers whose needs can be addressed without requiring costly controllers and noisy chillers while enhancing the user-experience. This paper presents the design improvement strategies implemented for developing the new line of CPU, Chipset and ASIC AC-TTs. Improved designs provide wider margining capability by using i) high performance active heat sink designs, ii) high power thermo-electric cooler (TEC), iii) cold plate designs compatible to keep out volume (KOV), iv) new choice of thermal interface material (TIM), and v) new retention design. This paper discusses the details of the design process and how multiple design strategies are implemented to finalize the design and to achieve the overall performance improvement while keeping the cost of the AC-TT low. The new line of AC-TT designs have performance improvement of 44% (~25C) for 130W CPU TT compared to existing CPU AC-TT, of 32% (~19C) for 60W chipset compared to existing chipset AC-TT, and of 41% (~8C) compared to existing 15W PCH (Peripheral Component Hub) AC-TT. Design strategies provided here can be easily adapted to develop future generation of low-cost CPU, chipset, and ASIC AC-TTs with a wider margining capability.},

abstract={Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed data storage that is highly concurrent and asynchronous due to network communication, testing such a system is very challenging. Our solution using the tool "Modbat" generates test cases for concurrent client sessions, and processes results from synchronous and asynchronous callbacks. We use an embedded model checker to compute the test oracle for non-deterministic outcomes, the oracle model evolves dynamically with each new test step. Our work has detected multiple previously unknown defects in ZooKeeper. Finally, a thorough coverage evaluation of the core classes show how code and branch coverage strongly relate to feature coverage in the model, and hence modeling effort.},

abstract={User guides, also known as user manuals, are a type of documentation aimed at helping a user operate a specific system. For software systems, user guides usually include screenshots that show users how to interact with the user interface. Because creating such screenshots is a slow, manual process, keeping the user guide up-to-date with changes in the user interface is challenging. We propose an approach in which the documentation writer interleaves the user guide text with source code that automates screen capturing. As a result, screenshots always reflect the latest software version, which makes the approach suitable for a project that uses continuous delivery. The approach was implemented as a prototype, called GuideAutomator.},

pages={214-221}, 
abstract={The prevailing practice for testing protocol implementations is direct code instrumentation to trigger specific states in the code. This leaves very little scope for reuse of the test cases. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of VirtualWire, a network fault injection and analysis system designed to facilitate the process of testing network protocol implementations. VirtualWire injects user-specified network faults and matches network events against anticipated responses based on high-level specifications written in a declarative scripting language. With VirtualWire, testing requires no code instrumentation and fault specifications can be reused across versions of a protocol implementation. We illustrate the effectiveness of VirtualWire with examples drawn from testing Linux's TCP implementation and a real-time Ethernet protocol called Rether. In each case, 10 to 20 lines of script is sufficient to specify the test scenario. VirtualWire is completely transparent to the protocols under test, and additional overhead in protocol processing latency it introduces is below 10% of the normal.},

abstract={We show how the effort needed to verify a transformed base model can be reduced by analyzing the definition of the modification. The Common Variability Language (CVL) is a generic language for modeling variability, where a CVL model describes the increment from one base model to another (transformed) base model. Assuming that a property of the base model has been verified, we use the CVL model to reduce the effort needed to verify the property of the transformed model. Based on the CVL model, we narrow down the set of traces required to be verified, including the increment and the cascading effects. We apply CVL to several models of the Train Control Language (TCL) to illustrate how the effort of verifying safety properties of transformed train station models can be reduced.},

abstract={Evolving metamodels are in the center of Model-Driven Engineering, necessitating the co-evolution of dependent artifacts like models and transformations. While model co-evolution has been extensively studied, transformation co-evolution has received less attention up to now. Current approaches for transformation co-evolution provide a fixed, restricted set of metamodel (MM) changes, only. Furthermore, composite changes are treated as monolithic units, which may lead to inconsistent co-evolution for overlapping atomic changes and prohibits extensibility. Finally, transformation co-evolution is considered in isolation, possibly inducing inconsistencies between model and transformation co-evolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a complete set of atomic MM changes being able to describe arbitrary MM evolutions. Reusability and extensibility are supported by means of change composition, ensuring an intra-artifact consistent co-evolution. Furthermore, each change provides resolution actions for both, models and transformations, ensuring an inter-artifact consistent co-evolution. Based on our conceptual approach, a prototypical implementation is presented.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) comprises billions of Internet-connected devices (ICD) or "things", each of which can sense, communicate, compute, and potentially actuate and can have intelligence, multimodal interfaces, physical/virtual identities, and attributes. Cyber-assurance is the justified confidence that networked systems are adequately secure to meet operational needs, even in the presence of attacks, failures, accidents, and unexpected events. The cyber-assurance recognition strategy is to define only the service-level interfaces and leave out domain-specific implementation details. Once the recognition of a cyber-attack has been identified from the recognition process, the fortification process takes place. Reestablishment is a means to return the ICDs to its operational condition after the cyber-attack through remapping to a different route since the ICD was under attack. When the IoT technologies are used as part of mission critical systems, the IoT services should be survivable in order to support the important missions.},

abstract={At the core of model-driven software development, model-transformation compositions enable automatic generation of executable artifacts from models. Although the advantages of transformational software development have been explored by numerous academics and industry practitioners, adoption of the paradigm continues to be slow, and limited to specific domains. The main challenge to adoption is the fact that maintenance tasks, such as analysis and management of model-transformation compositions and reflecting code changes to model transformations, are still largely unsupported by tools. My dissertation aims at enhancing the field's understanding around the maintenance issues in transformational software development, and at supporting the tasks involved in the synchronization of evolving system features with their generation environments. This paper discusses the three main aspects of the envisioned thesis: (a) complexity analysis of model-transformation compositions, (b) system feature localization and tracking in model-transformation compositions, and (c) refactoring of transformation compositions to improve their qualities.},

The usage of open source middleware to replace these proprietary solutions in a cost effective manner is an idea that can now bear fruition due to the relative maturity of such solutions.

title={Architectural timing verification of CMOS RISC processors}, 
year={1995}, 
volume={39}, 
number={1.2}, 
pages={113-129}, 
abstract={We consider the problem of verification and testing of architectural timing models ("timers") coded to predict cycles-per-instruction (CPI) performance of advanced CMOS superscalar (RISC) processors. Such timers are used for pre-hardware performance analysis and prediction. As such, these software models play a vital role in processor performance tuning as well as application-based competitive analysis, years before actual product availability. One of the key problems facing a designer, modeler, or application analyst who uses such a tool is to understand how accurate the model is, in terms of the actual design. In contrast to functional simulators, there is no direct way of testing timers in the classical sense, since the �correct� execution time (in cycles) of a program on the machine model under test is not directly known or computable from equations, truth tables, or other formal specifications. Ultimate validation (or invalidation) of such models can be achieved under actual hardware availability, by direct comparisons against measured performance. However, deferring validation solely to that stage would do little to achieve the overall purpose of accurate pre-hardware analysis, tuning, and projection. We describe a multilevel validation method which has been used successfully to transform evolving timers into highly accurate pre-hardware models. In this paper, we focus primarily on the following aspects of the methodology: a) establishment of cause-effect relationships in terms of model defects and the associated fault signatures; b) derivation of application-based test loop kernels to verify steady-state (periodic) behavior of pipeline flow, against analytically predicted signatures; and c) derivation of synthetic test cases to verify the �core� parameters characterizing the pipeline-level machine organization as implemented in the timer model. The basic tenets of the theory and its application are described in the context of an example processor, comparable in complexity to an advanced member of the PowerPC� 6XX processor family.},

abstract={File sharing applications using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks such as Bittorrent or eDonkey rapidly attracted a lot of people and proved the efficiency and interest of this P2P technology. Distribution of video and of live contents also experienced the P2P mechanisms with success. PPLive, UUSee and others have many of customers, hundreds of channels and thousands of concurrent users. However, major content providers are reluctant to use this technology because no solution to ensure the distribution of only legal contents is provided. In the same way, network operators do not really push towards P2P content distribution because bad organization of the overlay can lead to overload the network and consume a lot of networks resources. In this paper, a secure and legal network-aware P2P video system is introduced, which aims at overcoming those two drawbacks. The design of the system and the evaluation of a prototype showed good results and let us be optimistic about a possible deployment of P2P systems for video delivery, having the support of content providers as well as network operators.},

abstract={While testing is heavily used and largely automated in software development projects, the reuse of test practices across similar projects in a given domain is seldom systematized and supported by adequate methods and tools. This paper presents a practical approach that emerged from a concrete industrial case in the smart card domain at STMicroelectronics Belgium in order to better address this kind of challenge. The central concept is a test knowledge repository organized as a collection of specific patterns named QPatterns. A systematic process was followed, first to gather, structure and abstract the test practices, then to produce and validate an initial repository, and finally to make it evolve later on Testers can then rely on this repository to produce high quality test plans identifying all the functional and nonfunctional aspects that have to be addressed, as well as the concrete tests that have to be developed within the context of a new project. A tool support was also developed and integrated in a traceable way into the existing industrial test environment. The approach was validated and is currently under deployment at STMicroelectronics Belgium.},

abstract={Today's growing device complexity and new manufacturing requirements have presented significant challenges for manufacturers looking to speed time-to-market. One such challenge is the need to contain test costs, of which a major component is the time and resources required for test program development. Some test development tools that exist today can translate a device's functional events and scan patterns into test programs for targeted ATE. Identification and specification of critical timing parameters that require conversion into cycle-based ATE formats have become an increasing cost factor, which can also significantly impact test accuracy. Traditionally, timing specifications from microprocessor and IP cores, multiple bus types, and other device components can be established via published timing specifications and by a manageable, iterative process between design and test engineering. Likewise, automatic test pattern generation tools for structural test can address simple timing, and are capable of generating cycle-based timing. Today's complex SoC may consist of over 60 IP cores made more complicated by increased challenges from high-speed serial bus technology and multiple-time domain designs. Further complicating test program development is the need for compatibility with multiple ATE platforms to accommodate global manufacturing strategies. Next generation design-to-test software tools have to address these factors to help reduce the ever growing cost-of-test. Tools must support standard industry test languages such as standard test interface language (STIL), support both functional events and scan patterns, and validate outputs to ensure first-pass success of test programs pre- and post silicon, across multiple ATE platforms.},

abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) has recently gained unprecedented attention from industry and research communities, and it seems unlikely that this will be attenuated in the near future. The ideas brought by SDN, although often described as a �revolutionary paradigm shift� in networking, are not completely new since they have their foundations in programmable networks and control-data plane separation projects. SDN promises simplified network management by enabling network automation, fostering innovation through programmability, and decreasing CAPEX and OPEX by reducing costs and power consumption. In this paper, we aim at analyzing and categorizing a number of relevant research works toward realizing SDN promises. We first provide an overview on SDN roots and then describe the architecture underlying SDN and its main components. Thereafter, we present existing SDN-related taxonomies and propose a taxonomy that classifies the reviewed research works and brings relevant research directions into focus. We dedicate the second part of this paper to studying and comparing the current SDN-related research initiatives and describe the main issues that may arise due to the adoption of SDN. Furthermore, we review several domains where the use of SDN shows promising results. We also summarize some foreseeable future research challenges.},

Mobile testing using emulators which doesn't include real network traffic and testing mobile applications in more than one portable device in single system was also not possible in normal testing. In order to overcome the draw backs of normal testing, in this paper we deployed a Mobile Testing as a Service (MTAAS) framework in cloud environment. By using MTAAS framework many mobile applications can be tested in different portable devices and different mobile platforms. Testing of mobile applications using MTAAS provides most realistic results since it includes real network speed. Finally, we conducted an experiment in MTAAS framework and testing results shows that MTAAS can effectively reduce the complexity of mobile testing on different smart devices.},

Deployment of 3D video QoE monitors anywhere in the network will enable operators to adapt their service and network infrastructure in order to guarantee a desired QoE level, e.g., in scenarios where 3D IPTV streaming is offered to users with multi-homed equipment and simultaneous access to the network by means of heterogeneous smartcells in the customer premises.},

abstract={A residential gateway, heart of the strategy of most Telcos, is a centralized intelligent device between the operator's access network and the home's network. It terminates all external access networks and enables residential services to be delivered to the consumer. Besides a plethora of useful services, the growth in market depends upon the reputation of its resilience (availability, reliability and security). This emphasizes a near zero fault design and efficient testing should be taken care before its launch into the market. This paper deals with the analysis of failures, both from test and field data, aiming to increase the efficiency of laboratory testing. Using fault tree analysis, we study the faults that have passed through the testing phase and created failures in the customer premises. With the help of defined specifications, we have identified the zones in which testing in the laboratory needs to be improved.},

The experiment employed four subjects to conduct trials of use of the two technologies on a common set of test examples. The experiment was conducted with personnel supplied and supervised by an independent contractor. Test cases consisted of message specifications taken from Air Force C/sup 3/I systems. The main results are that greater productivity was achieved and fewer error were introduced when subjects used the program generator than when they used Ada templates to implement software modules from sets of specifications. The differences in the average performance of the subjects are statistically significant at confidence levels exceeding 99 percent.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={11-14}, 
abstract={Model checking at the design level makes it possible to find protocol flaws in security-critical applications automatically. But depending on the size of the application and especially on the abstraction of the application model, model checking may need a lot of resources, primarily time. To reduce the complexity, the application models are usually highly abstracted. But in a model-driven approach with automatic generation of runnable applications the application models need to be detailed and are often too complex to check in reasonable time. In this paper we describe an approach to handle this problem by using additional UML models to restrict the protocol runs, the attacker abilities and the numbers of participants. This makes model checking of large applications in our model-driven approach called SecureMDD possible without manual abstraction of the generated specifications. For model checking we use AVANTSSAR and show how the restrictions modeled within UML are translated. We demonstrate our approach with a smart card based electronic ticketing example.},

abstract={The adoption of multi- and many-core architectures for mainstream computing undoubtedly brings profound changes in the way software is developed. In particular, the use of fine grained locking as the multi-core programmer's coordination methodology is considered by more and more experts as a dead-end. The transactional memory (TM) programming paradigm is a strong contender to become the approach of choice for replacing locks and implementing atomic operations in concurrent programming. Combining sequences of concurrent operations into atomic transactions allows a great reduction in the complexity of both programming and verification, by making parts of the code appear to execute sequentially without the need to program using fine-grained locking. Transactions remove from the programmer the burden of figuring out the interaction among concurrent operations that happen to conflict when accessing the same locations in memory. The EU-funded FP7 VELOX project designs, implements and evaluates an integrated TM stack, spanning from programming language to the hardware support, and including runtime and libraries, compilers, and application environments. This paper presents an overview of the VELOX TM stack and its associated challenges and contributions.},

abstract={In this method, the VHDL model to be tested is represented by its process model graph (PMG). Test sets for individual processes of the model are precomputed and stored in the design library. The Hierarchical Behavioral Test Generator (HBTG) algorithm accepts the PMG and the precomputed tests as inputs, from which it hierarchically constructs a test sequence that tests the functionality of the model. Such an automatic test generation process relieves the modeler of the time-consuming task of developing test-benches. The test sequence generated by HBTG is then used for simulation of the model. Experimental results indicate that the tests generated exercise the model thoroughly.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Advances in technology are making it imperative to collect detailed structural IC fail data during manufacturing test to improve yield. However, there is currently no standard format for communicating and storing such structural fail data efficiently. This leads to ad-hoc tool-specific solutions, which do not offer interoperability required in a typical multi-tool, multi-vendor customer environment. These ad-hoc solutions result in unnecessary investment in development of point-to-point interface solutions that are ultimately still not integrated with the traditional data collection for a unified yield analysis data format. Expanding an established datalogging standard to accommodate the new requirements solves these issues. Standard Test Data Format (STDF) is the predominant format used today for traditional failure datalogging storage, but in its current form falls far short in handling the new high-volume structural failures for yield learning. A group of more than 20 companies from ATE, EDA, Semiconductor and Yield Management companies has been working on a new enhanced STDF standard that addresses the new requirements. This paper provides the overview of the new enhanced standard.},

year={2013}, 
volume={},

pages={714-717}, 
abstract={Cloud-based elastic computing systems dynamically change their resources allocation to provide consistent quality of service and minimal usage of resources in the face of workload fluctuations. As elastic systems are increasingly adopted to implement business critical functions in a cost-efficient way, their reliability is becoming a key concern for developers. Without proper testing, cloud-based systems might fail to provide the required functionalities with the expected service level and costs. Using system testing techniques, developers can expose problems that escaped the previous quality assurance activities and have a last chance to fix bugs before releasing the system in production. System testing of cloud-based systems accounts for a series of complex and time demanding activities, from the deployment and configuration of the elastic system, to the execution of synthetic clients, and the collection and persistence of execution data. Furthermore, clouds enable parallel executions of the same elastic system that can reduce the overall test execution time. However, manually managing the concurrent testing of multiple system instances might quickly overwhelm developers' capabilities, and automatic support for test generation, system test execution, and management of execution data is needed. In this demo we showcase AUToCLES, our tool for automatic testing of cloud-based elastic systems. Given specifications of the test suite and the system under test, AUToCLES implements testing as a service (TaaS): It automatically instantiates the SUT, configures the testing scaffoldings, and automatically executes test suites. If required, AUToCLES can generate new test inputs. Designers can inspect executions both during and after the tests.},

abstract={Small autonomous power systems (SAPS) that include renewable energy sources are a promising option for isolated power generation at remote locations. The optimal sizing problem of SAPS is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem, and its solution may prove a very time-consuming process. This paper initially investigates the performance of two popular metaheuristic methods, namely, simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS), for the solution of SAPS optimal sizing problem. Moreover, this paper proposes a hybrid SA-TS method that combines the advantages of each one of the above-mentioned metaheuristic methods. The proposed method has been successfully applied to design an SAPS in Chania region, Greece. In the study, the objective function is the minimization of SAPS cost of energy (�/kWh), and the design variables are: 1) wind turbines size, 2) photovoltaics size, 3) diesel generator size, 4) biodiesel generator size, 5) fuel cells size, 6) batteries size, 7) converter size, and 8) dispatch strategy. The performance of the proposed hybrid optimization methodology is studied for a large number of alternative scenarios via sensitivity analysis, and the conclusion is that the proposed hybrid SA-TS improves the obtained solutions, in terms of quality and convergence, compared to the solutions provided by individual SA or individual TS methods.},

This paper introduces a hybrid dialogue strategy to overcome the inflexibility of application-directed interactions while avoiding the significant recognition difficulty of a full mixed-initiative style. The system uses N-gram grammars to govern the recognition at the request segment of a dialogue, and employs an application-directed strategy at the clarification discourse segment. The paper also details generating a corpus for the N-gram grammar through a case-based reasoning approach, and constructing application-directed dialogues with decision trees.

abstract={The problem of knowing when to stop testing software is considered, focusing on the strategy of stopping when a reliability level or rate of failure occurrence acceptable to the customer is reached. The system's reliability is monitored throughout the system test, and the system is released to the field only when the measured reliability is at or above this objective. This approach was applied to test-failure data collected on Remote Measurement System-Digital 1, a large telecommunications testing system that had already gone through system test and been released to the field. The RMS-D1 failure data, which consisted of command-response errors versus commands executed, had been routinely collected by the system-test organization during testing. The testing phase analyzed, the load test, was an operational-profile-driven test in which a controlled load was imposed on the system reflective of the system's busy-hour usage pattern. It was found to be feasible to apply the reliability-measurement approach in real time, to systems actually undergoing system test, given a controlled load-test environment.<<ETX>>},

title={On the effectiveness of IP reputation for spam filtering}, 
year={2010}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-10}, 
abstract={Modern SMTP servers apply a variety of mechanisms to stem the volume of spam delivered to users. These techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: pre-acceptance approaches, which apply prior to a message being accepted (e.g. IP reputation), and post-acceptance techniques which apply after a message has been accepted (e.g. content based signatures). We argue that the effectiveness of these measures varies based on the SMTP sender type. This paper focuses on the most light-weight pre-acceptance filtering mechanism-IP reputation. We first classify SMTP senders into three main categories: legitimate servers, end-hosts, and spam gangs, and empirically study the limits of effectiveness regarding IP reputation filtering for each category. Next, we develop new techniques that build custom IP reputation lists, which significantly improve the performance of existing IP reputation lists. In compiling these lists, we leverage a somewhat surprising fact that both legitimate domains and spam domains often use the DNS Sender Policy Framework (SPF) in an attempt to pass simple authentication checks. That is, good/bad IP addresses can be systematically compiled by collecting good/bad domains and looking up their SPF resource records. We also evaluate the effectiveness of these lists over time. Finally, we aim to understand the characteristics of the three categories of email senders in depth. Overall, we find that it is possible to construct IP reputation lists that can identify roughly 90% of all spam and legitimate mail, but some of the lists, i.e. the lists for spam gangs, must be updated on a constant basis to maintain this high level of accuracy.},

abstract={Systematic exploration of hypotheses is a major part of any empirical research. In software engineering, we often produce unique tools for experiments and evaluate them independently on different data sets. In this paper, we present KernelHaven as an experimentation workbench supporting a significant number of experiments in the domain of static product line analysis and verification. It addresses the need for extracting information from a variety of artifacts in this domain by means of an open plug-in infrastructure. Available plug-ins encapsulate existing tools, which can now be combined efficiently to yield new analyses. As an experimentation workbench, it provides configuration-based definitions of experiments, their documentation, and technical services, like parallelization and caching. Hence, researchers can abstract from technical details and focus on the algorithmic core of their research problem. KernelHaven supports different types of analyses, like correctness checks, metrics, etc., in its specific domain. The concepts presented in this paper can also be transferred to support researchers of other software engineering domains. The infrastructure is available under Apache 2.0: https://github.com/KernelHaven. The plug-ins are available under their individual licenses.},

abstract={Deep Learning (DL) techniques are now widespread and being integrated into many important systems. Their classification and recognition abilities ensure their relevance for multiple application domains far beyond pure signal processing. As a machine-learning technique that relies on training instead of explicit algorithm programming they offer a high degree of productivity. But recent research has shown that they can be vulnerable to attacks and the verification of their correctness is only just emerging as a scientific and engineering possibility. Moreover DL tools are not integrated into classical software engineering so software tools to specify, modify and verify them would make them even more mainstream as software-hardware systems. This paper surveys recent work and proposes research directions and methodologies for this purpose.},

abstract={A platform is a set of hardware, software, and process building blocks that can form the basis of many different products. The goals of platforms are to reuse and/or share assets wherever possible, to save on development costs, to spread fixed development and production costs across the largest volumes, and to offer highly integrated solutions, all while maintaining critical differentiation of products. Using platforms correctly can produce substantial life-cycle cost benefits and can lead to enhanced supplier management and customer satisfaction. This paper will begin by describing the general concept of platforms. It will then consider their economic benefits to development teams, suppliers, and customers. Next, it will discuss the role of industry standards in forming the basis of a platform offer. It will consider the changing architectures of telecommunications networks, along with the contribution of platforms to these changes. Finally, the paper will outline an example set of platform building blocks and their requirements, along with some case studies of how to combine these building blocks into products.},

Based on experiences from this project, we present reflections and discuss pitfalls in drawing a linked data publishing methodology. An integrated view on all phases of the publishing process has not been described so far, for the technical phases linked data life-cycles have been identified only. The methodology developed enables stakeholders to transfer the lessons learned to other use cases and application contexts.

The authors describe in detail the design-for-testability techniques specifically intended for the IC manufacturer production test and other ad hoc test/diagnostic structures for the customer to use in evaluating system performance. A global test strategy for testing the ISDN U transceiver is presented. The test features have been used extensively not only for testing the device in the production environment but also for conducting evaluations and design verification experiments during the chip debugging phase. The test features described are well integrated with the architecture of the chip, thus minimizing incremental cost.<<ETX>>},

Verification proceeded at four basic levels defined by the breadth of logic being tested. The lowest level, designer macro verification, contained a single designer's hardware description language (in VHDL). Unit-level verification consisted of a logical portion of function that generally contained four or five designers' logic. The third level of verification was the chip level, in which the processor or L2 chips were individually tested. Finally, system-level verification was performed on symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) configurations that included bus-switching network (BSN) chips and I/O connection chips, designated as memory bus adaptors (MBAs), along with multiple copies of the processor and L2 chips.},

abstract={Embedded systems are a class of computer systems that are typically characterized by a tight interaction with the physical environment. Various methodologies have been adopted for the development of such systems, ranging from traditional waterfall to modern agile techniques. One of the agile techniques that has recently attracted increasing attention is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). BDD promotes the engagement of all stakeholders in every development iteration to minimize the misunderstanding between technical and non-technical stakeholders and, consequently, to speed up the development process and lower the costs. In this paper, we investigate the application of BDD to the development of embedded systems, especially focusing on the testing of timing requirements for real-time embedded software. In particular, we extend BDD with time-related concepts and propose an approach to generate test code for the verification of timing behavior of real-time embedded systems. Our approach offers more automation for the development of test code compared to existing BDD tools, thus minimizing the risk of timing faults and reducing development costs and time-to-market.},

abstract={The development of railway systems is often supported by a range of tools, each addressing individual, but overlapping concerns such as, e.g., performance or safety analysis. However, it is a challenge for users to organise work-flows; results are often in different, non-aligning data formats; furthermore, tools work on different levels of abstraction from macro to microscopic. Thus, tool integration would be beneficial, and also allow for more playful, experimental prototyping and design. This paper reports on lessons learned from the integration of BRaVE - the Birmingham Railway Virtual Environment - and OnTrack from Swansea University. BRaVE is an easy-to-use railway simulation software for development, modelling and flow analysis. OnTrack allows for the automatic verification of scheme plans against a number of safety properties via different formal methods. We present an approach that bridges the gap that occurs from varying details in data sources through automated transformations. This integration provides a first step towards a seamless environment for prototyping, concept development, and safety analysis under �one roof�. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by giving integrated simulation and verification results for the UK East Coast Main Line. This work is part of the wider RSSB's Future Traffic Regulation Optimisation research programme.},

abstract={WebRTC comprises a set of novel technologies and standards that provide Real-Time Communication on Web browsers. WebRTC makes simple the embedding of voice and video communications in all types of applications. However, releasing those applications to production is still very challenging due to the complexity of their testing. Validating a WebRTC service requires assessing many functional (e.g. signaling logic, media connectivity, etc.) and non-functional (e.g. quality of experience, interoperability, scalability, etc.) properties on large, complex, distributed and heterogeneous systems that spawn across client devices, networks and cloud infrastructures. In this article, we present a novel methodology and an associated tool for doing it at scale and in an automated way. Our strategy is based on a blackbox end-to-end approach through which we use an automated containerized cloud environment for instrumenting Web browser clients, which benchmark the SUT (system under test), and fake clients, that load it. Through these benchmarks, we obtain, in a reliable and statistically significant way, both network-dependent QoS (Quality of Service) metrics and media-dependent QoE (Quality of Experience) indicators. These are fed, at a second stage, to a number of testing assertions that validate the appropriateness of the functional and non-functional properties of the SUT under controlled and configurable load and fail conditions. To finish, we illustrate our experiences using such tool and methodology in the context of the Kurento open source software project and conclude that they are suitable for validating large and complex WebRTC systems at scale.},

We evaluate the feasibility of these commonly lower-cost devices to meet the requirements of a customized, carrier-grade network function. Therefore, we have implemented a prototype on generic hardware, re-using as much open-source software as possible. Our Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) prototype can lower the cost compared to proprietary network appliances, and, known to have a hardware backplane capacity of 720 Gbps, the merchant-silicon / ASIC approach can highly outperform the state of the art of current x86-based virtualized network functions, while implementing the most important BRAS features.},

abstract={IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is an architectural framework to provide VoLte and other multimedia services. It is based on ETSI standards like SIP for interfaces between architectural elements.[9] IMS(IP Multimedia subsysytem) was originally designed by the wireless standards body 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). IMS(IP Multimedia subsysytem) is the key element in the 3G architecture that makes it possible to provide cellular access to all the services that the Internet provides. It is considered as a bridge between[9] cellular network and internet. The introduction of Configuration Management (CM) Repository Server (CMRepo Server) is an important prerequisite for the mass roll out of network elements (NEs), such as, Call Session Control Function (CSCF) and Home Subscriber Server (HSS). It is also required to pre-administer important parameters of the NEs that are required for IMS functionality. Thus, CMRepo Server provides the central CM system to manage multiple NEs. NetAct functions as the central CM system for managing online changeable parameters (class D and class E parameters). Management of other parameters (class A, B, and C parameters) is done through the customization procedure, which is time consuming as well as complex. Management of these parameters in simplified with the introduction of CMRepo Server. NetAct is an OSS Platform.

abstract={Modern organizations are faced with the need to rapidly respond to frequent changes arising from external business pressures. The effect of such continuous evolution eventually leads to organizational misalignment, that is, situations in which sub-optimal configurations of underlying systems significantly reduce an organization's ability to meet its strategic goals. Ensuring alignment of an organization's systems and its goals has been a concern of researchers and practitioners in the enterprise architecture (EA) domain. Unfortunately, current approaches do not adequately address alignment problems that modern organizations face. In this paper we propose that alignment concerns can be better addressed by making models the primary entities that stakeholders within and outside of an organization use to interact with the organization. We call an organization that maintains and uses an integrated set of models to manage alignment concerns a Model Driven Organization (MDO). In this paper we characterize the alignment problem, discuss the shortcomings of current alignment management approaches and present our MDO vision.},

abstract={In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, regulations apply across organizations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) scenarios as the basis of an automated compliance test suite for standards such as regulation and interoperability. Such test suites could become a shared asset for use by all systems subject to these regulations and standards. Each system, then, need only create their own system-specific test driver code to automate their compliance checks. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our proposal, we developed an abbreviated HIPAA test suite and applied it to three open-source electronic health record systems. The scenarios covered all security behavior defined by the selected regulation. The system-specific test driver code covered all security behavior defined in the scenarios, and identified where the tested system lacked such behavior.},

abstract={Software testing is an important part of project development. Depending on system type and size, it is performed variously. Unit testing is one of the available approaches that is used to ensure that behavior of small software parts is consistent with requirements. It allows to improve software quality and decrease overall costs. Despite the fact that such an approach is commonly judged as a vital concept, it is not usual in control software. In this paper, the comprehensive approach to test the IEC 61131-3 software using unit tests is presented. It supports to create tests in two ways-either in textual and graphical IEC 61131-3 languages or in the CPTest+ dedicated test definition language. The latter is equipped with many advanced features, such as test fixtures and inclusions, parameterized and analog signal extensions, mock objects, as well as a few kinds of suites. The overall solution runs on the developer and testing station; hence, it does not have significant impact on performance of the control program and tests are more reliable and repeatable. To explain the concept, the simple running example is presented in this paper. The described solution has been introduced in the CPDev engineering environment for programming controllers.},

abstract={End-user acceptance criteria of live-stream based, interactive applications are different from traditional B2B or B2C applications. For example, if users sense disruptions in audio or video stream quality, they may quickly form a negative opinion. The Quality of Experience (QoE) in such live-stream applications is, thus, based on perception, and is open to subjective interpretations. QoE can be affected by hundreds of possible variables. QoE problems (QoE bugs), however, require an objective solution (fix in the product's code or tuning of product parameters). Understanding and debugging QoE bugs in such scenarios starts with designing relevant metrics and analysis tools. Thereafter, smart test-designs and strategies are required to gain insights into bottlenecks. This paper builds a discussion around these thoughts, and through a case study (sample QoE problem in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application), collates some generic guidelines to investigate QoE bugs in live-streaming scenarios.},

The FITMAN Anlzer implementation is domainindependent and allows any manufacturer to effectively train it based on his needs and create personalized reports to timely capture the right information.

pages={1084-1097}, 
abstract={Overlay network monitoring enables distributed Internet applications to detect and recover from path outages and periods of degraded performance within seconds. For an overlay network with end hosts, existing systems either require measurements, and thus lack scalability, or can only estimate the latency but not congestion or failures. Our earlier extended abstract [Y. Chen, D. Bindel, and R. H. Katz, ldquoTomography-based overlay network monitoring,rdquo Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2003] briefly proposes an algebraic approach that selectively monitors linearly independent paths that can fully describe all the paths. The loss rates and latency of these paths can be used to estimate the loss rates and latency of all other paths. Our scheme only assumes knowledge of the underlying IP topology, with links dynamically varying between lossy and normal. In this paper, we improve, implement, and extensively evaluate such a monitoring system. We further make the following contributions: i) scalability analysis indicating that for reasonably large n (e.g., 100), the growth of k is bounded as O(n log n), ii) efficient adaptation algorithms for topology changes, such as the addition or removal of end hosts and routing changes, iii) measurement load balancing schemes, iv) topology measurement error handling, and v) design and implementation of an adaptive streaming media system as a representative application. Both simulation and Internet experiments demonstrate we obtain highly accurate path loss rate estimation while adapting to topology changes within seconds and handling topology errors.},

abstract={Future space missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory and Project Constellation suggest the engineering of some of the most complex man-rated software systems. The present process-oriented certification methodologies employed by NASA are becoming prohibitively expensive when applied to systems of such complexity. The process of software certification establishes the level of confidence in a software system in the context of its functional and safety requirements. Providing such certification evidence may require the application of a number of software development, analysis, and validation techniques. We define product-oriented certification as the process of measuring the system's reliability and efficiency based on the analysis of its design (expressed in models) and implementation (expressed in source code). In this work we introduce a framework for model-based product-oriented certification founded on the concept of source code enhancement and analysis. We describe a classification of the certification artifact types, the development and validation tools and techniques, the application domain-specific factors, and the levels of abstraction. We demonstrate the application of our certification platform by analyzing the process of model-based development of the parallel autonomic goals network, a critical component of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Mission Data System (MDS). We describe how we identify and satisfy seven critical certification artifacts in the process of model-driven development and validation of the MDS goal network. In the analysis of this process, we establish the relationship among the seven certification artifacts, the applied development and validation techniques and tools, and the level of abstraction of system design and development.},

abstract={In agile development, Requirements Engineering (RE) and testing have to cope with a number of challenges such as continuous requirement changes and the need for minimal and manageable documentation. In this sense, extensive research has been conducted to automatically generate test cases from (structured) natural language documents using Model-Based Testing (MBT). However, the imposed structure may impair agile practices or test case generation. In this paper, inspired by cooperation with industry partners, we propose CLARET, a notation that allows the creation of use case specifications using natural language to be used as central artifacts for both RE and MBT practices. A tool set supports CLARET specification by checking syntax of use cases structure as well as providing visualization of flows for use case revisions. We also present exploratory studies on the use of CLARET to create RE documents as well as on their use as part of a system testing process based on MBT. Results show that, with CLARET, we can document use cases in a cost-effective way. Moreover, a survey with professional developers shows that CLARET use cases are easy to read and write. Furthermore, CLARET has been successfully applied during specification, development and testing of industrial applications.},

abstract={A hazard of ongoing Network Function Virtualization (NFV) realizations is the lack of a common understanding in support of development, deployment and operation tasks related to Virtual Function Networks (VNFs), NFV components and interfaces. In the current state of affairs, NFV stakeholders commonly create their own terminology to define and describe NFV components, following going the specifications led by European Telecommunications Standard Institute but also adopting telecommunication- and software-centric definitions. As a consequence, portability and interoperability goals of NFV get compromised since NFV technology providers have hard times in understanding and using definitions and descriptions across different domains. Furthermore, VNF data models of operational systems and deployment configuration software need to be re-defined, re-coded, and re-compiled to make them work over different NFV platforms. In this work, we present the design and implementation of our proposed NFV Ontology (NOn) enabling Semantic nFV Services (SnS) to reduce manual intervention during the integration process of heterogeneous NFV domains and effectively overcome the costly re-work hazards of current NFV implementation approaches. We present the proof of concept implementation of a Generic Client leveraging SnS/NOn to create and consume dynamic workflows in an open source testbed based on OpenStack and OpenBaton.},

abstract={Modern software applications are adapted to different situations (e.g., memory limits, enabling/disabling features) by only changing few configuration option values without any source code modifications. According to several studies, this flexibility is expensive. Indeed, configuration errors represent one of the largest percentage of software errors, they are hard to debug and resolve, while comprehension of the code also is hampered by sprinkling conditional checks of configuration options. Although researchers have proposed various approaches to help debug or prevent configuration errors, especially from the end users' perspective, this paper takes a step back to understand the activities required by practitioners to engineer the software configuration options in their source code, the challenges they experience as well as best practices that they have or could adopt. By interviewing 14 software engineering experts, followed by a large survey on 229 software engineers, we identified 9 major activities related to configuration engineering, 22 challenges faced by developers, and 25 expert recommendations to improve software configuration quality. We complemented this study by a systematic literature review to enrich the experts' recommendations, and to identify possible solutions for the developers' challenges discussed and evaluated by the research community.},

abstract={Industrial automation and control systems (IACS) play a key role in modern production facilities. On the one hand, they provide real-time functionality to the connected field devices. On the other hand, they get more and more connected to local networks and the internet in order to facilitate use cases promoted by �Industry 4.0�. This makes IACS susceptible to cyber-attacks which exploit vulnerabilities, for example in order to interrupt the automation process. Security testing targets at discovering those vulnerabilities before they are exploited. In order to enable IACS manufacturers and integrators to perform security testing for their devices, we present ISuTest, a modular security testing framework for IACS. ISuTest is designed to be extendable regarding all kinds of automation protocols, different connection paths as well as evaluating arbitrary outputs of the tested devices. This paper describes the fundamental ideas behind ISuTest, its design and a basic evaluation in which the ISuTest framework was able to discover a vulnerability in a programmable logic controller (PLC). The paper concludes with a broad overview of the planned future work.},

What makes this article particularly distinctive, aside, of course, from the fact that it focuses on the major contributions of French engineers to the development of packet switching as well as to X.25 standardization, is that it carefully outlines the reasons for the choice of connection-oriented virtual circuits for the Transpac network, as contrasted with datagram-based packet switching adopted for Arpanet. Interestingly, Dr. Despres notes that the idea of using virtual-circuit connection-oriented packet switching in the Transpac development came from the British packet switching activity. It is to be noted that early commercial packet switching networks in the United States, such as Tymnet and Telenet, also adopted the virtual circuit paradigm.},

abstract={Enterprise applications today have acquired the need to be distributed due various demanding reasons. Such systems are developed with focus on distributed concerns than on the application logic. This diverted the developers from the functional requirement of the system and burdened them with the responsibility of developing and maintaining code related to distributed concerns. The main intention of this research is to facilitate development of distributed systems without any consideration for distributed concerns. We suggest a way where the application is initially designed without them and later enabled by integrating the framework proposed in this research. We confine our interest in separating persistence and replication among other distributed concerns. The motivation for this research comes by recognizing the fact that such a framework drastically reduces the code and complexity involved to make a distributed application resilient to failures and thereby to minimize the effort necessary to debug, deploy and maintain.},

abstract={Retrofitting design patterns into a program by hand is tedious and error-prone. A programmer must distinguish refactorings that are provided by an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from those that must be realized manually, determine a precise sequence of refactorings to apply, and perform this sequence repetitively to a laborious degree. We designed, implemented, and evaluated Reflective Refactoring (R<sup>2</sup>), a Java package to automate the creation of classical design patterns (Visitor, Abstract Factory, etc.), their inverses, and variants. We encoded 18 out of 23 Gang-of-Four design patterns as R<sup>2</sup> scripts and explain why the remaining are inappropriate for refactoring engines. We evaluate the productivity and scalability of R<sup>2</sup> with a case study of 6 real-world applications. In one case, R<sup>2</sup> automatically created a Visitor with 276 visit methods by invoking 554 Eclipse refactorings in 10 minutes - an achievement that could not be done manually. R<sup>2</sup> also sheds light on why refactoring correctness, expressiveness, and speed are critical issues for scripting in next-generation refactoring engines.},

pages={}, 
abstract={The following Guidance document addresses the use of radio frequency 1 (RF) wireless technology for the transport of medical data both to and from point-of-care (PoC) medical devices. The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumption, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073- 0305.x standards only.},

abstract={Deep Space 1 (DS1) is the first deep-space mission of NASA's New Millennium technology validation program. The DS1 flight software will validate five autonomy technologies: 1) Planner/Scheduler, which receives ground or on-board requests for spacecraft activities and schedules them to resolve any resource conflicts or timing constraints; 2) Smart Executive, which expands planned activities into lower-level commands, deduces required hardware configurations or other actions, and provides detection and avoidance of constraint violations; 3) Mode Identification and Reconfiguration engine, which incorporates models of hardware and software behavior, detects discrepancies due to hardware or software failures, and requests recovery actions via the Smart Executive. 4) Autonomous Navigation, which determines the spacecraft trajectory from images of asteroids against the celestial sphere, and autonomously adjusts the trajectory to reach the target asteroid or comet. 5) Beacon Monitoring, which uses radio carrier modification and telemetry summarization to simplify ground monitoring of spacecraft health. Integration of these technologies into the spacecraft flight software architecture has presented a number of system engineering challenges, Some of these technologies were developed in a research-oriented, non-real-time, artificial intelligence organizational culture while spacecraft software is typically developed in a strong real-time, algorithmically-oriented culture. The Navigation technology has been developed in a ground-based environment. Integration of these different cultures and mutual education of the software team has been achieved. An early rapid prototype of an existing spacecraft design proved very valuable in educating the team members and in working out the development process.},

abstract={Many testing and benchmarking scenarios in software and systems engineering depend on the systematic generation of graph models. For instance, tool qualification necessitated by safety standards would require a large set of consistent (well-formed or malformed) instance models specific to a domain. However, automatically generating consistent graph models which comply with a metamodel and satisfy all well-formedness constraints of industrial domains is a significant challenge. Existing solutions which map graph models into first-order logic specification to use back-end logic solvers (like Alloy or Z3) have severe scalability issues. In the paper, we propose a graph solver framework for the automated generation of consistent domain-specific instance models which operates directly over graphs by combining advanced techniques such as refinement of partial models, shape analysis, incremental graph query evaluation, and rule-based design space exploration to provide a more efficient guidance. Our initial performance evaluation carried out in four domains demonstrates that our approach is able to generate models which are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger (with 500 to 6000 objects!) compared to mapping-based approaches natively using Alloy.},

abstract={Embedded software for modern automotive and avionic systems is increasingly complex. In early design phases, even when there is still uncertainty about the feasibility of the requirements, valuable information can be gained from models that describe the expected usage and the desired system reaction. The generation of test cases from these models indicates the feasibility of the intended solution and helps to identify scenarios for which the realization is hardly feasible or the intended system behavior is not properly defined. In this paper we present the formalization of requirements by models to simulate the expected field usage of a system. These so called usage models can be enriched by information about the desired system reaction. Thus, they are the basis for all subsequent testing activities: First, they can be used to verify the first implementation models and design decisions w.r.t. the fulfillment of requirements and second, test cases can be derived in a random or statistic manner. The generation can be controlled with operational profiles that describe different classes of field usage. We have applied our approach at a large German car manufacturer in the early development phase of active safety functionalities. Test cases were generated from the usage models to assess the implementation models in MATLAB/Simulink. The parametrization of the systems could be optimized and a faulty transition in the implementation models was revealed. These design and implementation faults had not been discovered with the established test method.},

abstract={The wide-scale introduction of model-based testing techniques in an industrial context faces many obstacles. One of the obstacles is the existing methodology gap between informally described test purposes and formally defined test descriptions used as the starting point for test automation. The provision of an explicit test description becomes increasingly essential when integrating complex, distributed systems and providing support for conformance and interoperability tests of such systems. The upcoming ETSI standard on the Test Definition Language (TDL) covers this gap. It allows describing scenarios on a higher abstraction level than programming or scripting languages. Furthermore, TDL can be used as an intermediate representation of tests generated from other sources, e.g. simulators, test case generators, or logs from previous test runs. TDL is based on a meta-modelling approach that expresses its abstract syntax. Deploying this design approach, individual concrete syntaxes of TDL can be designed for different application domains. The paper provides an overview of TDL and discusses its application on a use case from the rail domain.},

title={Model Transformation Modularization as a Many-Objective Optimization Problem}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={43}, 
number={11}, 
pages={1009-1032}, 
abstract={Model transformation programs are iteratively refined, restructured, and evolved due to many reasons such as fixing bugs and adapting existing transformation rules to new metamodels version. Thus, modular design is a desirable property for model transformations as it can significantly improve their evolution, comprehensibility, maintainability, reusability, and thus, their overall quality. Although language support for modularization of model transformations is emerging, model transformations are created as monolithic artifacts containing a huge number of rules. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of automatically modularizing model transformation programs was not addressed before in the current literature. These programs written in transformation languages, such as ATL, are implemented as one main module including a huge number of rules. To tackle this problem and improve the quality and maintainability of model transformation programs, we propose an automated search-based approach to modularize model transformations based on higher-order transformations. Their application and execution is guided by our search framework which combines an in-place transformation engine and a search-based algorithm framework. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by using ATL as concrete transformation language and NSGA-III as search algorithm to find a trade-off between different well-known conflicting design metrics for the fitness functions to evaluate the generated modularized solutions. To validate our approach, we apply it to a comprehensive dataset of model transformations. As the study shows, ATL transformations can be modularized automatically, efficiently, and effectively by our approach. We found that, on average, the majority of recommended modules, for all the ATL programs, by NSGA-III are considered correct with more than 84 percent of precision and 86 percent of recall when compared to manual solutions provided by active developers. The statistical analysis of our experiments over several runs shows that NSGA-III performed significantly better than multi-objective algorithms and random search. We were not able to compare with existing model transformations modularization approaches since our study is the first to address this problem. The software developers considered in our experiments confirm the relevance of the recommended modularization solutions for several maintenance activities based on different scenarios and interviews.},

We describe challenges regarding the evolution of avionics software by means of real-world evolution scenarios that arise in industrial practice. A key role plays a legally-binding certification process, called qualification, which is responsible for most of the development effort and cost. To reduce effort and cost, we propose a novel generative approach to develop qualifiable avionics software by combining model-based and product-line technology. Using this approach, we have already generated code that is running on the NH90 helicopter and that is in the process of replacing the current system code. Based on an interview with two professional developers at Airbus and an analysis of the software repository of the NH90, we systematically compare our approach with established development approaches in the avionics domain, in terms of implementation and qualification effort.},

abstract={Software testing is an important part of software maintenance, but it can also be very expensive. To reduce this expense, software testers may select part of their test cases so that those that are more important are run earlier in the testing process. However, the methods that can be used to select test cases for service composition and its analysis are still lacking at present. This paper proposes an aspect orientation based test case selection strategy for service composition. Aspect-orientation is used to weave testing crosscutting concerns of service composition, which includes component testing concern and testing concern of service composition, the weaving mechanism dynamically integrates these schemas into a testing enforcement model. Based on this, the test cases selection strategy for service composition is given, and abstract it as a crosscutting concern to weave into testing model, the corresponding enforcement algorithm is also given, the operation semantics and related theories of Petri nets help prove its effectiveness and feasibility. A case study explains the testing process of service composition, and a series of experiments are done to explain that the use of aspects for testing Web service is more efficient than conventional techniques, which can improve the testing quality and efficiency.},

abstract={Due to C's overwhelming dominance in industry, reactive embedded applications usually rely on conventional sequential programming. Adopted approaches favor event-driven paradigms which prevent function-oriented code decomposition in particular. This encourages the violation of fundamental software engineering principles. The reactive programming paradigm is proposed as a general solution. However, most reactive languages cannot keep up with C's practical advantages. It appears, that the subfamily of synchronous languages provides promising features but real-world deployments and evaluations are rarely reported in literature. On this account, we make two major contributions in this paper. First, we elaborate how the lack of function-oriented software decomposition manifests in a real-life industrial application. Second, we provide a corresponding re-implementation which illustrates the deployment and discusses the gained engineering benefits provided by the third-party, synchronous-reactive programming language C�u. We believe that our work generally reveals a practicable way of improving embedded software quality in industrial applications.},

abstract={Environmental monitoring is critical in understanding whether the quality of our environment is getting better or worse. Information gathered by using an environmental monitoring system is important to make decisions. Vietnam is a vulnerable country of climate change. Specially, in the South of Vietnam, the Mekong delta is known as the region getting the most impact of sea level rise in Vietnam. That leads to a lot of problems making the worst effects to residents in the area, who are mainly still very poor. On the other hand, Vietnam is going on industrialization process that makes a strong effect on the environment. To deal with these challenges, different projects of environment management have been proposed and implemented and many monitoring systems have been built in those projects. Those systems are basically sensor networks with high cost in developing and maintaining. They are related to modern technology such as cloud, communication mobile and wireless. They provide the data for large community for different purposes. Therefore, building such a system is normally a long term project that requires an incremental and modular development for a complex system. This paper, on one hand, represents some common characteristics of an environment monitoring system that requires more study to develop a formal model and a methodology for their specifications, implementations and verification. On the other hand, we would like to adapt the formal model approach proposed for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to an environmental monitoring system. The framework of Baobab is also introduced as an example for transformation from model to code.},

abstract={Internet of Things is a novel paradigm that combined microcomputer and wireless communication technology.

They able to do the dynamic addressing, finding a neighbor and do the routing task such as in Xbee technology. In the future, pervasive sensing will support adaptive context-aware services that are not provided by the wireless sensor network protocol in the link and the network layer. Our research proposed pervasive device and service discovery protocol at the application level by creating a protocol in the smart sensor device and the smart sensor gateway. By implementing our protocol, the sensor network gateway is able to find each of the sensor network device and service descriptions and request the on-demand service to the smart sensor device. The protocol is implemented in two Arduino Uno integrated with XBee transceiver as the smart sensor device and the raspberry pi as the smart sensor gateway. Result shows, the gateway was able to find both device and service description in the smart sensor network with 4.13 seconds average time. The average round trip time for request and response data from the gateway is 0.201 seconds.},

abstract={Mention �test case�, and it conjures up the image of a script or a program that exercises a system under test. In industrial practice, however, test cases often start out as steps described in natural language. These are essentially directions a human tester needs to follow to interact with an application, exercising a given scenario. Since tests need to be executed repeatedly, such manual tests then have to go through test automation to create scripts or programs out of them. Test automation can be expensive in programmer time. We describe a technique to automate test automation. The input to our technique is a sequence of steps written in natural language, and the output is a sequence of procedure calls with accompanying parameters that can drive the application without human intervention. The technique is based on looking at the natural language test steps as consisting of segments that describe actions on targets, except that there can be ambiguity in identifying segments, in identifying the action in a segment, as well as in the specification of the target of the action. The technique resolves this ambiguity by backtracking, until it can synthesize a successful sequence of calls. We present an evaluation of our technique on professionally created manual test cases for two open-source web applications as well as a proprietary enterprise application. Our technique could automate over 82% of the steps contained in these test cases with no human intervention, indicating that the technique can reduce the cost of test automation quite effectively.},

abstract={Industrial automation systems are tested nowadays mainly via system tests at a very late stage of development. These tests are conducted manually, are time-consuming and cost-intensive. Earlier testing of automation software, e.g., component testing, is therefore desired in order to reduce the effort for system testing by detecting errors sooner. In this paper we present an improved concept for a test environment that enables developers of industrial control electronics to test the functionality of IEC 61499 software components. Components can be tested on any hardware with an IEC 61499 runtime environment, even on the target hardware. There is no need to change the automation software for testing. We propose using dynamically typed languages to implement tests because such languages have inherent properties that are useful for this task. We provide example code of a typical test case.},

abstract={Predicting reliability of software under development is an important part of estimations in software engineering projects. In many organizations as the goal is that software products are released with no known defects, the process of finding and removing defects correlates with the effort for software projects. Software development projects estimate the resources needed to design, develop, test and release software products, and the number of defects which have to be handled. In this paper we present a model for consequence analysis of inaccurate predictions of quality in software projects. The model is a result of multiple case studies and is evaluated at two companies. The model recognizes the most common mispredictions - e.g. Over- and under-prediction, early- and late-predictions - and the combination of theses. The results from the industrial evaluation show that the consequences can be grouped according to under- and over-predictions and that the late- and early-predictions have the same consequences. The results show also that mispredicting the shape of the reliability curve has a significant consequence with regard to assessment of release readiness and resource planning.},

abstract={It is almost impossible to prevent requirement change in the web development life cycle. Selenium despite being a widely used open source automated tool for testing web application, has its limitation when it concerns test data management. Frequent changes in requirement result in changes in the user interface which in turn requires additional effort to re-record the test script. Eventually keeping track of test data used for each test script becomes very problematic for the tester. In this paper, we analyse existing tools and provide a design of an automated testing tool, Kishanium that also manages the set of test data. A prototype was created during experimentation phase to prove the concept of the underlying ideas of the proposed tool. The prototype has been implemented based on the core technologies of DomDocument, XPath and Curl. The testing carried out proves that Kishanium is a useful automated tool that can be used on its own or in conjunction with Selenium. With a very systematic approach it automatically searches input and button objects, allows testers to add new test data, edit existing test data and delete previous test data in order to respond to frequent requirement changes. The power of Kishanium is that it is able to re-use existing test data even if there are a number of changes in the user interface. It also automatically runs the tests with the appropriate set of test data using its Poster Component. Moreover the Kishanium automated tool provides additional features such as Data generator, Spylink and Snapshot.},

abstract={We review design and development decisions and their impact for the open source code Nmag from a software engineering in computational science point of view. We summarise lessons learned and recommendations for future computational science projects. Key lessons include that encapsulating the simulation functionality in a library of a general purpose language, here Python, provides great flexibility in using the software. The choice of Python for the top-level user interface was very well received by users from the science and engineering community. The from-source installation in which required external libraries and dependencies are compiled from a tarball was remarkably robust. In places, the code is a lot more ambitious than necessary, which introduces unnecessary complexity and reduces main- tainability. Tests distributed with the package are useful, although more unit tests and continuous integration would have been desirable. The detailed documentation, together with a tutorial for the usage of the system, was perceived as one of its main strengths by the community.},

With new technologies and commercialization of I.T. sector, the web based system has undergoes frequent and rapid changes. Today Softwares are coded as a web based application, which help to access data from any part of the globe. Even the economic relevance of web based enhances the control and quality of software. The quality assurance of any system depends on its test. But to do manually testing in most of the cases is time consuming, expensive and hectic. For the better business purpose and to save time and money automation testing is required. There are variety of tools are available in the market for this. One of the best known tool is selenium suite which is a combination of different automation testing tool. In this paper we will discuss about the selenium suite. It provides testers with different framework for different test cases. The main objective of this paper is to find the best tool in selenium suite and then compare it with some other tool for same task. For this purpose, performance evaluation is done on the basis of some criteria.},

This paper discusses the area of mission planning, and present EKLOPS as a generic mission planning solution proposed by the Mission Planning Group of Anite Systems GmbH. EKLOPS has evolved from mission planning systems that were developed under contracts of the European Space Agency. It implements an adaptive object model architecture to integrate the common elements of mission planning systems. The model of a specific satellite mission is expressed as metadata, which configure the MPS. Rules implement functions of the planning process for which a number of specific roles can be identified. The paper presents a language that has so far been utilized to express constraint-checking rules. The experience made with EKLOPS is shown using the examples of the ENVISAT and Mars Express missions. The generic nature of EKLOPS facilitates an extension of its usage outside the field of spacecraft operations planning},

abstract={In the software development process, one of the recurring problems is to ensure that the expectations of stakeholders are being met. These expectations must match the system's behavior and be present in the requirements specifications and models. The Requirements Engineering discipline studies how to capture, specify, validate and manage requirements. However, recent empirical studies show that stakeholders do not usually understand traditional requirements models. This paper focuses on the cognitive evaluation of a user-centered language called BehaviorMap that aims to specify behavioral user scenarios in a cognitive way, based on mind map modelling. This paper describes an experimental evaluation to verify the understandability of the BehaviorMap scenarios compared to the textual ones. The experiment gathered data from 15 individuals (na�ve-users), with different backgrounds, that had to analyze 8 scenarios, being 4 graphical and 4 textual. To assess the participants' cognitive effort, it was used questionnaires. Also, the time effort to perform the tasks was measured. This experiment showed promising results for the BehaviorMap scenarios.},

abstract={This paper describes the Remote Agent flight experiment for spacecraft commanding and control. In the Remote Agent approach, the operational rules and constraints are encoded in the flight software. The software may be considered to be an autonomous "remote agent" of the spacecraft operators in the sense that the operators rely on the agent to achieve particular goals. The experiment will be executed during the flight of NASA's Deep Space One technology validation mission. During the experiment, the spacecraft will not be given the usual detailed sequence of commands to execute. Instead, the spacecraft will be given a list of goals to achieve during the experiment. In flight, the Remote Agent flight software will generate a plan to accomplish the goals and then execute the plan in a robust manner while keeping track of how well the plan is being accomplished. During plan execution, the Remote Agent stays on the lookout for any hardware faults that might require recovery actions or replanning. In addition to describing the design of the remote agent, this paper discusses technology-insertion challenges and the approach used in the Remote Agent approach to address these challenges. The experiment integrates several spacecraft autonomy technologies developed at NASA Ames and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory: on-board planning, a robust multi threaded executive, and model-based failure diagnosis and recovery.},

volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1145-1156}, 
abstract={Refactoring engines are standard tools in today's Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). They allow programmers to perform one refactoring at a time, but programmers need more. Most design patterns in the Gang-of-Four text can be written as a refactoring script - a programmatic sequence of refactorings. In this paper, we present R3, a new Java refactoring engine that supports refactoring scripts. It builds a main-memory, non-persistent database to encode Java entity declarations (e.g., packages, classes, methods), their containment relationships, and language features such as inheritance and modifiers. Unlike classical refactoring engines that modify Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), R3 refactorings modify only the database; refactored code is produced only when pretty-printing ASTs that reference database changes. R3 performs comparable precondition checks to those of the Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT) but R3's codebase is about half the size of the JDT refactoring engine and runs an order of magnitude faster. Further, a user study shows that R3 improved the success rate of retrofitting design patterns by 25% up to 50%.},

abstract={Requirements Engineering establishes the process for defining requirements as one in which elicitation, modeling and analysis are tasks which must be carried out. This process should involve different stakeholders and their different viewpoints. Among these stakeholders, there is the software designer, responsible for creating models based on the information gathered by business specialists. However, this communication channel may create some "noise" that leads to information being lost. This loss produces a semantic gap between what is desired and what will be developed. The semantic gap is characterized by inconsistencies in the requirements represented by scenarios -- user stories in a behavior-driven context -- and by the conceptual model. This paper presents an interactive approach to the agile requirements modeling, thus fostering greater consistency between the artifacts of the scenarios and the conceptual model. This consistency is ensured by using a mind model specification which will serve as a basis for transforming the definitions of the scenario and generating a conceptual model represented by a UML class diagram. The mind model represents the main role of this approach, and functions as a bond that represents the business entities, thus enabling the requirements to be more consistent with the reality of the business.},

pages={42-49}, 
abstract={Integrated services delivered over broadband connections are becoming the norm in domestic households, as it is the case with triple-play bundles which offer combined Voice, Television and Data services delivered using IP-based technologies and protocols. As a result, the usage of SIP-based (Session Initiation Protocol) VoIP devices has known a significant growth in domestic environments, either in the form of standalone (e.g. SIP telephones) or embedded devices (as it happens with some domestic gateways, which embed analog-to-SIP adaptors). For Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the provisioning and management of those devices is a challenge - especially standalone SIP phones, since most of them were exclusively designed for corporate LAN usage, not supporting adequate mechanisms for remote management over broadband access networks. In this paper we propose a framework which allows the integration of off-the-shelf SIP phones with the CWMP protocol suite, the prevailing standard for remote management of Customer Premises Devices (CPEs) in broadband access networks. This integration framework supports the vast majority of commercially available SIP phones whilst maintaining full compatibility with the original CWMP specification - thus allowing ISPs to reuse their CWMP management infrastructure to configure and provision off-the-shelf SIP telephones.},

There is a demand for researching the ways in which model transformation can become more flexible, efficient, highly-configurable as well as validated. This paper addresses issues of visually defined metamodel-based model transformations that support validated model transformations.

These tools provide enough information to allow circuit modification, in order to meet a prescribed testability value. The efficiency of these tools is due to the use of a statistical method combined with formal proof mechanisms. The random testability of the complete ISCAS benchmark of combinational circuits is computed.

abstract={This guide applies the smart grid interoperability reference model (SGIRM) process (IEEE Std 2030-2011) to energy storage by highlighting the information relevant to energy=storage system (ESS) interoperability with the energy power system (EPS). The process can be applied to ESS applications located on customer premises, at the distribution level, and on the transmission level (i.e., bulk storage). This guide provides useful industry-derived definitions for ESS characteristics, applications, and terminology that, in turn, simplify the task of defining system information and communications technology (ICT) requirements. As a result. these requirements can be communicated more clearly and consistently in project specifications. This guide also presents a methodology that can be used for most common ESS projects to describe the power system, communications, and information technology (IT) perspectives based on the IEEE 2030 definitions. From this framework, a seemingly complex system can be more clearly understood by all project stakeholders. Emerging cybersecurity requirements can also be incorporated into the framework as appropriate. Additionally, this guide provides the templates that can be used to develop requirements for an ESS project and goes through several real-world ESS project examples step by step.},

We illustrate the concept with an industrial case study and describe the experiments run by a team who had set a goal for itself to get better at testing. Beyond technical aspects, we explain how these experiments have changed the mindset and the behaviour of the team members. We then present an open source test analytics platform, later developed to share the positive learnings with the community. We describe the platform features and architecture and explain how it can be easily put to use. Before the conclusions, we explain how test analytics fits in the broader context of software analytics and present our ideas for future work.},

abstract={Commonly used open source configuration management systems, such as Puppet, Chef and CFEngine, allow for system configurations to be expressed as scripts. A number of quality issues that may arise when executing these scripts are identified. An automated quality assurance service is proposed that identifies the presence of these issues by automatically executing scripts across a range of environments. Test results are automatically published to a format capable of being consumed by script catalogues and social coding sites. This would serve as an independent signal of script trustworthiness and quality to script consumers and would allow developers to be made quickly aware of quality issues. As a result, potential consumers of scripts can be assured that a script is likely to work when applied to their particular environment. Script developers can be notified of compatibility issues and take steps to address them.},

abstract={Today's ongoing trend towards intense usage of web service based applications in daily business and everybody's daily life poses new challenges for security testing. Additionally, such applications mostly not execute in their own runtime environment but instead are deployed in some data center, run alongside multiple other applications, and serve different purposes for sundry user domains with diverging security requirements. As a consequence, security testing also has to adapt to be able to meet the necessary requirements for each application in its domain and its specific security requirements. In addition, security testing needs to be feasible for both service providers and consumers. In our paper we identify drawbacks of existing security testing approaches and provide directions for meeting emerging challenges in future security testing approaches. We also introduce and describe the idea of language-oriented security testing, a novel testing approach building upon domain-specific languages and domain knowledge to meet future requirements in security testing.},

abstract={Every year several contributions to the model-based testing (MBT) field are published. Therefore, to follow the evolution and trends of several tools and models available is difficult. Moreover, since the variety of models and tools that became available in recent years, choosing an approach to support the MBT process is a challenging activity. The main objective of this study is to provide an overview on MBT tools and models used by those tools. Furthermore, the authors' study can help academic researchers and companies to understand the topics involving MBT. Therefore, a systematic mapping study was conducted in which 1197 distinct papers were evaluated. At the end, 87 primary studies were selected to be analysed in a quantitative and qualitative way. As a result, they classified the tools and models that are currently used to support MBT. Moreover, they identified 70 MBT tools, as well as different domains in which MBT is already applied to. Therefore, there are some evidence that MBT continues to be a broad and `alive' research field since every year a significant number of papers presenting different kinds of contributions are published.},

abstract={DevOps (a portmanteau of �development� and �operations�) is a software development method that extends the agile philosophy to rapidly produce software products and services and to improve operations performance and quality assurance. It was born to accelerate the delivery of Web-based systems and quickly bring new value to users. Many Web-based systems evolve according to usage trends without a clear long-term goal. Before the widespread use of Web services, most software with a clear goal were delivered as packages that users installed on their own system. New versions were delivered with a much lower frequency, with periods in between versions ranging from months to years. Development cycles were divided into large design, coding and testing phases culminating in the release of a new stable version. In software development in the context of applied science, even when the goal is clear, the process to attain it is not. Hence, working releases that capture the current software state must be released frequently in order to reduce the risks for all stakeholders and to make it possible to assess the current state of a project and steer it in the right direction. This paper explores the usefulness of DevOps concepts to improve the development of software that supports scientific projects. We establish the similarities and differences between scientific projects and Web applications development, and discuss where the related methodologies need to be extended. Unique challenges are discussed herewith developed solutions, and still open questions. Lessons learned are highlighted as best practices to be followed in research projects. This discussion is rooted in our experience in real-life projects at the IBM Research Brazil Lab, which just as well apply to other research institutions.},

abstract={The impact of infusing breakthrough autonomy technology into a flight project was a big surprise. Valuable technical and cultural lessons, many of general applicability when introducing system-level autonomy, have been learned by infusing the Remote Agent (RA) into NASA's Deep Space 1 (DS1) spacecraft. The RA's architecture embodies system-level autonomy in three major components: planning and scheduling, execution, and fault diagnosis and reconfiguration. Lessons learned include: the architecture was confirmed; active participation by nonautonomy personnel in the development is essential; communication of new concepts is essential, difficult, and hampered by differences in terminology; giving a spacecraft system-level autonomy changes organizational roles in operating the spacecraft after launch, and hence changes roles during development; software models supporting functions traditionally handled on the ground must be developed early enough to get on-board; shortfalls in planned features must be technically and developmentally accomodatable, in particular not to threaten the launch schedule; traditional commanding must be supported; testing must be emphasized. These lessons and others, on incremental system releases and use of autocode generation, are based on 16 months of spiral development from start of project through the project's decision to reduce the role of the RA from full-time control of the spacecraft to a separable experiment.},

abstract={Coping with adaptive software systems is one of the key challenges testing is currently faced with. In our previous work, we proposed to enable the test system itself to be adaptive to the system under test as a solution. The adaptation is built up on the concepts of a self-aware test automation enabling to use this information to sequence, instantiate, or update the test suite to the current situation. In our test framework the modeling language S# allows to use a run-time model to do so in a model-based testing approach. In this paper, we demonstrate how our concepts of adaptive, self-aware test automation are applied to a real world scenario: testing an adaptive resource manager of Hadoop. We show the steps necessary to implement the approach and discuss our experiences in this case study paper.},

The essence is to apply TDD at each of four levels of language processing, hence we call our approach Multi-Level TDD, or MLTDD. MLTDD can be applied to programming languages, preprocessors, domain specific languages, and transformation engines. MLTDD was used to build Umple, a model-oriented programming language available for Java, Ruby, and PHP.

In this paper, we present a case study from the SAP context showing the interactions between two SAP service components and use that case study to derive a set of modeling requirements. This motivates a discussion about applicable techniques for service choreography modeling and whether existing choreography languages cover the identified needs.},

abstract={Aspectual Business Process Modelling is not a new concept in business process based development to support the separation of the cross cutting concerns. Most of the researchers use the concept of the heavyweight extensions of the business processes to incorporate the aspects. This requires changes in the meta-models of the languages and the tool infrastructures, which is not a feasible option. Some of the researchers also provide lightweight extensions in the form of profiles, but these are mostly incomplete and do not provide solutions for modelling some important aspectual concepts like Pointcuts effectively. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we provide a lightweight extension of the business processes expressed in BPMN to incorporate the aspect specific concepts in it. We propose a profile ABPMN which uses the existing notations of the BPMN models for expressing aspectual concepts. Further, we developed a language PCDL to express the pointcuts in an effective way. The language is implemented using XText in Eclipse. To evaluate the applicability of our approach, we applied it on a case study of the E-Bidding system.},

abstract={Formal methods tools, whose underlying principles are based on mathematics and formal logic, are considered one of the most effective and rigorous means of verifying system properties and assuring the absence of undesirable system behavior. The use of such tools seem to squarely fit the needs of those aiming to develop and certify avionic software as per the DO-178C standard, the set of objectives laid out by FAA to achieve a high level of confidence on the systems. However, our recent work on a NASA-funded research project revealed that there are practical considerations and additional complexities involved in using formal method tools to provide the level of assurance as exemplified by the DO-178C. In this paper we discuss one of the key concerns with formal tools: its soundness - the characteristic of a tool to never permit the verified system property be declared true when it is actually not true. We explored two major classes of formal methods tools - namely model checkers and static analyzers - and observed several threats to their soundness such as tool fallacies and failure modes that could lead to misplaced confidence in the verified system. We present various strategies to mitigate them, including an assurance case framework to verify that potential risks are all mitigated.

abstract={There is a compelling need for highly customized Domain Specific Languages and Business Vocabulary in certain industries such as insurance, mortgage, and finance to enable Knowledge Workers to articulate and to automate complex rules pertinent to their areas of function within their companies. Rule Engine vendors attempt to provide a solution to the problem by selling an integrated Rules Engine and Business Rules Management System. Usually, the BRMS's provided by vendors need to be customized and integrated into the overall Enterprise Architecture. This results in the Enterprise Architecture to be tightly coupled with the vendor's rule offering. Moreover, it poses a significant risk to the Enterprise as vendor solutions change between releases. The Enterprise Architecture needs a way to insulate itself from such impacts. This paper describes a framework that delivers the core BRMS functions of authoring and representation in a vendor neutral fashion. In addition, the paper sheds light on specific areas of the framework that can be standardized.},

title={Do program transformations help reverse engineering?}, 
year={1998},

pages={247-254}, 
abstract={Program transformations have been advocated as a method for accomplishing reverse engineering. The hypothesis is that the original source code can be progressively transformed into alternative forms, but with the same semantics. At the end of the process, an equivalent program is acquired, but one which is much easier to understand and more maintainable. We have been undertaking an extensive programme of research over twelve years into the design and development of transformations for the support of software maintenance. The paper very briefly explains the theory, practice and tool support for transformational systems, but does not present new theoretical results. The main results are on an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, based on experience with case studies and industrial applications. The evaluation framework used (called DERE) is that presented in Bennett and Munro (1998). It is hoped that the results will be of benefit to industry, who might be considering using the technology; and to other researchers, interested in addressing the open problems. The overall conclusion is that transformations can help in the bottom-up analysis and manipulation of source code at approximately the 3GL level, and have proved successful in code migration, but need to be complemented by other top-down techniques to be useful at higher levels of abstraction or in more ambitious re-engineering projects.},

abstract={Software product line (SPL) testing is a tougher work than testing of single systems. Still testing of each individual SPL product would be perfect but it is too costly in practice. In fact, when the number of features increases then the number of possible products also increases exponentially usually derived from a feature model. Number of features is leading to thousands of different products. Due to cost and time constraints, it is infeasible or large number of effort to run all the test cases in an existing test suite. To decrease the cost of testing, various techniques have been proposed. One of them is test case prioritization (TCP) techniques. Here we presented a survey for TCP techniques for software SPL.},

In the heterogeneous and manifold context of modern computation, it is impossible to predict, at design time, all the possible configurations of such technologies, and especially the way users will be willing to interact with them.

abstract={Information technology applications and systems are essential to businesses and enterprises as they implement business components of the enterprise. In some cases, IT is the business, such as with financial services. Optimizing Return-on-Investment (ROI) in the IT area is essential to the business performance. Reducing cost is one component of ROI, however the predominant value is increasing revenue. IT is essential to the enterprise agilely to exploit new business opportunities. Cloud computing is emerging as a technology for optimizing IT costs and supporting agility. Enterprises are incrementally moving to cloud computing in an exploratory, ad hoc manner. Since, enterprises think in terms of IT Services that IT provides to the business, and an IT service is interconnecting hardware and software resources, the management aspects are conceptually similar to a manufacture or retail supply chain. As a result, exploiting cloud computing is a supply chain management problem for IT services using cloud computing. This paper describes the architecture requirements and implementation of a set of components for optimizing the IT supply chain using cloud computing.},

abstract={Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a technique that promotes separation of concerns. Unfortunately, it still suffers from well-known composition issues, in particular from undesirable interferences when multiple concerns are applied at the same join point. In this paper we propose an approach to detect interferences side effect using executable assertions. The assertions are inserted in the aspect chain to detect various types of interferences. The implementation is based on the AIRIA resolver construct, recently introduced to better control conflicting aspects in AspectJ. Resolvers add observation points that were lacking in AspectJ. We propose to take advantage of this to implement automated detection of interferences at execution time. We study the feasibility of this approach and demonstrate it on artificial examples.},

year={2018}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={In this work a platform-aware model-driven engineering process for building component-based embedded software systems using annotated analysis models is described. The process is supported by a framework, called MICOBS, that allows working with different component technologies and integrating different tools that, independently of the component technology, enable the analysis of non-functional properties based on the principles of composability and compositionality. An actor, called Framework Architect, is responsible for this integration. Three other actors take a relevant part in the analysis process. The Component Provider supplies the components, while the Component Tester is in charge of their validation. The latter also feeds MICOBS with the annotated analysis models that characterize the extra-functional properties of the components for the different platforms on which they can be deployed. The Application Architect uses these components to build new systems, performing the trade-off between different alternatives. At this stage, and in order to verify that the final system meets the extra-functional requirements, the Application Architect uses the reports generated by the integrated analysis tools. This process has been used to support the validation and verification of the on-board application software for the Instrument Control Unit of the Energetic Particle Detector of the Solar Orbiter mission.},

abstract={Coverage Directed test Generation (CDG) is rife with challenges and problems, despite the relative successes of machine learning methodologies over the years in automating it. This paper introduces the use of the eXtended Classifier System (XCS) in simulation-based digital design verification. It argues for the use of this novel genetics-based machine learning technique to perform effective CDG by learning the full mapping between coverage results and test generator directives. Using the resulting production rules, efficient test suites can be constructed, and inference on the validity of the verification environment can be made. There is great potential in using XCS for design verification and this paper forms an initial attempt to highlight the associated advantages. The technique requires no domain knowledge to setup and satisfies important CDG requirements. Once matured, it is expected to be utilized seamlessly in any industrial level simulation-based verification process.},

abstract={Due to rapid improvements in the area of embedded processing hardware, the complexity of developed systems constantly increases. In order to ensure a high quality level of such systems, related quality assurance concepts have to evolve. The introduction of Model-Based Testing (MBT) approaches has shown promising results by automating and abstracting multiple activities of the software testing life cycle. Nevertheless, there is a strong need for approaches supporting scoped test models, i.e. subsets of test cases, reflecting specific test purposes driven by risk-oriented development strategies. Therefore, we developed an integrated and model-based approach supporting test case management, which incorporates the beneficial aspects of abstract development methodologies with predominant research for test case management in non-model-based scenarios. Based on a new model artifact, the integration model, tasks like cross-domain information mapping and the integration of domain-specific KPIs derived by analyses favor the subsequently applied constraint-based mechanism for test case management. Further, a prototypical implementation of these concepts within the Architecture And Analysis Framework (A3F) is elaborated and further evaluated based on representative application scenarios. A comparative view on related work leads to a conclusive statement regarding our future work.},

abstract={Testing as a Service (TaaS) is a new business and service model that provides efficient and effective software quality assurance and enables the use of a cloud for the meeting of quality standards, requirements and consumer's needs. However, problems that limit the effective use of TaaS involve lack of standardization in writing, execution, configuration and management of tests and lack of portability and interoperability among TaaS platforms - the so-called lock-in problem. The lock-in problem is a serious threat to software testing in the cloud and may become critical when a provider decides to suddenly increase prices, or shows serious technical availability problems.

We introduce a construction algorithm for applications built on the Jax-WS standard and validate its effectiveness on sample applications from Apache CXF and JBossWS. Then, we demonstrate its applicability for taint analysis over a sample application of our making. Our CACG construction algorithm accurately identifies service call targets 81.07% of the time on average. Our taint analysis obtains a F-Measure of 95.60% over a benchmark. The use of a CACG, compared to a naive approach, improves the F-Measure of a taint analysis from 66.67% to 100.00% for our sample application.},

abstract={The complexity of computer based systems (CBSs) requires that multiple levels of abstraction be available to a designer in order to facilitate their formal specification. Generating final executable code from the model of the system is preferred to hand-coding the implementation, but this is seldom done in one step-usually there are several cascading transformations that eventually result in the executable system. We explain how the concept of the technological space (TS) can be used to define and describe the layers between cascading transformations, and the transformations themselves. TSs are also shown as a categorization that better distinguishes between a domain and the technology used to store information in a domain.},

abstract={Automated and systematic testing of automation systems (AS) and production systems (PS) require an integrated testing tool chain for test case development, execution and reporting. In practice, the test automation tool chain cannot be fully automated because of missing links between different tools used in the test automation process. Closing these gaps typically require (high) human effort. Furthermore, domain and software testing expertise is often bundled by one (expensive) engineer who is responsible for the application domain (reflected in use cases and test cases) and software tests (software test code). This paper presents a flexible Testing Automation Framework (TAF) that enables the configuration of test processes involving different tools and various layers for test automation and enables separated roles for the application domain and software tests. We build on best-practice test automation from Software Engineering and design a test automation process for the automation systems domain. We demonstrate the feasibility with a use case, derived from production systems automation, with selected tools covering all test automation layers. First results showed the feasibility of the framework in the evaluation use case making test processes more flexible and automated. Although the successful implementation of the TAF can support the efficient configuration and execution of test processes, there is additional effort for preparing the flexible and automated tool chain.},

abstract={Continuous Integration (CI) is a popular practice where software systems are automatically compiled and tested as changes appear in the version control system of a project. Like other software artifacts, CI specifications require maintenance effort. Although there are several service providers like Travis CI offering various CI features, it is unclear which features are being (mis)used. In this paper, we present a study of feature use and misuse in 9,312 open source systems that use Travis CI. Analysis of the features that are adopted by projects reveals that explicit deployment code is rare&#x2014;48.16% of the studied Travis CI specification code is instead associated with configuring job processing nodes. To analyze feature misuse, we propose Hansel&#x2014;an anti-pattern detection tool for Travis CI specifications. We define four anti-patterns and Hansel detects anti-patterns in the Travis CI specifications of 894 projects in the corpus (9.60%), and achieves a recall of 82.76% in a sample of 100 projects. Furthermore, we propose Gretel&#x2014;an anti-pattern removal tool for Travis CI specifications, which can remove 69.60% of the most frequently occurring anti-pattern automatically. Using Gretel, we have produced 36 accepted pull requests that remove Travis CI anti-patterns automatically.},

year={2008}, 
volume={},

pages={}, 
abstract={The following Guidance document addresses the use of radio frequency 1 (RF) wireless technology for the transport of medical data both to and from point-of-care (PoC) medical devices. The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumption, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073-0305.x standards only.},

We present the architecture of the Berlin RoofNet (BRN) and a distributed realization of services like DHCP, ARP and Internet gateway discovery and selection. In addition, results of a detailed simulation and experimental evaluation comparing our distributed hash table based approach to traditional methods are presented.

abstract={Programs using service-oriented architecture (SOA) often feature ultra-late binding among components. These components have well-defined interfaces and are known as Web services. Messages between every pair of Web services dually conform to the output interface of a sender and the input interface of a receiver. Unit testing of Web services should not only test the logic of Web services, but also assure the correctness of the Web services during input, manipulation, and output of messages. There is, however, little software testing research in this area. In this paper, we study the unit testing problem to assure components written in orchestration languages, WS-BPEL in particular. We report an empirical study of the effectiveness of the Frankl-Weyuker data flow testing criteria (particularly the all-uses criterion) on WS-BPEL subject programs. Our study shows that conventional data flow testing criteria can be much less effective in revealing faults in interface artifacts (WSDL documents) and message manipulations (XPath queries) than revealing faults in BPEL artifacts.},

abstract={Many of the tools used today in semiconductor test engineering are single-point solutions that are concerned with the mechanics of translating test IP between domains and formats. There is no cohesive standardized framework to bind them all together; and workflow and application architecture choices are largely left up to the individual engineer. Learning from the state-of-the-art in other software engineering domains, we have developed a modern framework for semiconductor engineering that favors a convention-based approach to application architectures. By following conventions, powerful abstractions can be created to enable truly modular test development within a unified environment for the creation of test patterns, test programs, and all other test collateral. The paper reviews the background and some of the main capabilities of the framework and discusses how it is being used in production today to replace many conventional pattern flows. This is also a formal announcement that Freescale Semiconductor is open-sourcing the Origen Semiconductor Developer's Kit (SDK) to enable future development to be done in collaboration with the global semiconductor engineering community.},

abstract={Modifications to a virtual private network's (VPN's) topology, security, service provisioning options, or quality of service (QoS) typically require an end-user request to their service provider, whose personnel currently perform the VPN management. This process incurs more provisioning delay and is more costly than user self-provisioning. This paper presents a new service approach and dynamic virtual private network (D-VPN) technology that marries VPNs with directory enabled networking and Web-based subscriber service selection. It places VPN management into the hands of the user to produce instantaneous results, lowering service-provider operations costs, and subsequently reducing the cost to the end user. The paper also describes the target architecture and framework as well as the initial types of services that could be supported by D-VPN technology.3},

abstract={Nowadays, the design of software systems is pushed towards agile development practices. One of its most fundamental approaches is Test Driven Development (TDD). This procedure is based on test cases which are incrementally written prior to the implementation. Recently, Behavior Driven Development (BDD) has been introduced as an extension of TDD, in which natural language scenarios are the starting point for the test cases. This description offers a ubiquitous communication mean for both the software developers and stakeholders. Following the BDD methodology thoroughly, one would expect 100 % code coverage, since code is only written to make the test cases pass. However, as we show in an empirical study this expectation is not valid in practice. It becomes even worse in the process of development, i.e. the coverage decreases over time. To close the coverage gap, we sketch an algorithm that generates BDD-style scenarios based on uncovered code.},

abstract={Software testing is essential and takes a large part of resources during software development. This motivates automating software testing as far as possible. Frameworks for automating unit testing are approved and applied for a plethora of programming languages to write tests for small units in the same programming language. Both constraints, unit size and programming language, inhibit automation of software testing in domain of mobile software frameworks. This circumstance has motivated the development of a new testbed for a framework in the domain of mobile systems. In this paper, we describe requirements and challenges in testing mobile software frameworks in general and present a novel testbed for the APOXI framework that addresses these requirements. The main ideas behind this testbed are the usage of a scripting language to specify test cases and to incorporate domain-specific aspects on the language level. The testbed facilitates component and system testing but can be used for unit testing as well.},

abstract={Software-based digital systems are progressively replacing analog systems in safety-critical applications. However the ability to predict their reliability is not well understood and needs further study. A first step towards systematic resolution of this issue was presented in a recent software engineering measure study. In that study a set of software engineering measures were ranked with respect to their ability in predicting software reliability through an expert opinion elicitation process. This study also proposed a concept of reliability prediction system (RePS) to bridge the gap between software engineering measures and software reliability. The research presented in this paper validates the rankings obtained and the concept of RePS proposed in the previous study.},

abstract={The testing of mobile application faces many issues due to the complexity of testing these applications and the limited resources available in mobile devices. Testing in various mobile devices under varying conditions takes a lot of time when done manually. Also by using emulators it is not possible to generate the same real time network connections and real device characteristics. There is a need for a testing framework that allows automated testing of mobile applications in many mobile devices in limited time. In this paper we propose a mobile testing framework in the cloud environment that aims to provide automated testing of mobile applications in various mobile devices. This testing framework has an automated testing tool, the Mobile Application Testing (MAT) Tool integrated to it that performs functional, performance and compatibility testing of mobile applications.},

abstract={Testing Cyber-Physical Systems is becoming increasingly challenging as they incorporate advanced autonomy features. We investigate using an external runtime monitor as a partial test oracle to detect violations of critical system behavioral requirements on an automotive development platform. Despite limited source code access and using only existing network messages, we were able to monitor a hardware-in-the-loop vehicle simulator and analyze prototype vehicle log data to detect violations of high-level critical properties. Interface robustness testing was useful to further exercise the monitors. Beyond demonstrating feasibility, the experience emphasized a number of remaining research challenges, including: approximating system intent based on limited system state observability, how to best balance the simplicity and expressiveness of the specification language used to define monitored properties, how to warm up monitoring of system variable state after mode change discontinuities, and managing the differences between simulation and real vehicles when conducting such tests.},

abstract={Information Technology (IT) usage in enterprises has evolved over the last years. This led to today's complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic IT system landscapes that support business processes in enterprises. To manage these landscapes, the IT Service Management (ITSM) concept is gaining more importance in today's business and research. Studies demonstrate that introducing ITSM standards lead to positive effects, such as improved customer-orientation as well as efficiency and transparency of IT support, which justify the costs of implementation. However, companies still face difficulties in deciding which processes to be implement (first), and to which extent. Questions like: "How can the currently applied ITSM be adapted or extended when new business-related or technological challenges appear?" arise. Goods producing companies started early relying on Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). PLM delivers a solid means to define, discuss, analyze, and better standardize value creation processes. With PLM in mind, we propose a concept to adopt and further develop it towards IT Service Lifecycle Management (ITSLM) suitable for the IT services provider environment. After introducing ITSLM, analyzing its processes, and its correlation to PLM, we design ITSLM as a model-driven process support. The selection of appropriate models with different complexity can be used to implement and adapt standard supporting tasks with minimum effort. Two use cases are detailed: fault-tolerance design optimization as well as automation of IT service provisioning. In these areas, suitable model complexity levels, computer-aided task support as well as the knowledge transfer among these models are discussed.},

abstract={One way to manage the complexity of software systems is to compose them from reusable components, instead of starting from scratch. Components may be implemented in different programming languages and are tied together using configuration files, or glue code, defining instantiation, initialization and interconnections. Although correctly engineering the composition and configuration of components is crucial for the overall behavior, there is surprisingly little support for incorporating this information in the static verification and validation of these systems. Analyzing the properties of programs within closed code boundaries has been studied for some decades and is well-established. This paper contributes a method to support analysis across the components of a component-based system. We build upon the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel to reverse engineer homogeneous models for systems composed of heterogeneous artifacts. Our method is implemented in a prototype tool that has been successfully used to track information flow across the components of a component-based system using program slicing.},

The major providers of ATC systems are system integrators that address such requirements at the cost of a very expensive testing effort. They envisage Model Driven Testing (MDT) as a promising approach to reduce this effort while achieving better product quality. Within the context of a public-private partnership for software innovation in the ATC domain, we address the problem of integrating MDT into a software development process based on Model Driven Architecture.

abstract={Emerging mega-trends (e.g., mobile, social, cloud, and big data) in information and communication technologies (ICT) are commanding new challenges to future Internet, for which ubiquitous accessibility, high bandwidth, and dynamic management are crucial. However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.},

PBGT is a new model based testing approach that aims to increase systematization, reusability and diminish the effort in modelling and testing. It is based on the concept of User Interface Test Patterns (UITP) that contain generic test strategies for testing common recurrent behaviour, the so-called UI Patterns, on GUIs through its possible different implementations after a configuration step. Although PBGT was developed having web applications in mind, it is possible to develop drivers for other platforms in order to test a wide set of applications. However, web and mobile applications are different and only the development of a new driver to execute test cases over mobile applications may not be enough. This paper describes a study aiming to identify the adaptations and updates the PBGT should undergo in order to test mobile applications.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

abstract={Enterprise applications are difficult to test because their intended functionality is either not described precisely enough or described in cumbersome business rules. It takes a lot of effort on the part of a test architect to understand all the business rules and design tests that "cover" them, i.e., exercise all their constituent scenarios. Part of the problem is that it takes a complicated set up sequence to drive an application to a state in which a business rule can even fire. In this paper, we present a business rule modeling language that can be used to capture functional specification of an enterprise system. The language makes it possible to build tool support for rule authoring, so that obvious deficiencies in rules can be detected mechanically. Most importantly, we show how to mechanically generate test sequences--i.e., test steps and test data--needed to exercise these business rules. To this end, we translate the rules into logical formulae and use constraint solving to generate test sequences. One of our contributions is to overcome scalability issues in this process, and we do this by using a novel algorithm for organizing search through the space of candidate sequences to discover covering sequences. Our results on three case studies show the promise of our approach.},

In this work, a novel model testing approach specifically designed to assist the engineer in model transformation evolution is presented. A statistical analysis of the actual behavior of the transformations is performed by means of the computation of well-known information extraction metrics.

year={2018}, 
volume={},

pages={1-1}, 
abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a new network paradigm that promises control/data plane separation and centralized network control. While these features simplify network management and enable innovative networking, they give rise to persistent concerns about reliability. The new paradigm suffers from the disadvantage that various network faults may consistently undermine the reliability of such a network, and such faults are often new and difficult to resolve with existing solutions. To ensure SDN reliability, fault management, which is concerned with detecting, localizing, correcting and preventing faults, has become a key component in SDN networks. Although many SDN fault management solutions have been proposed, we find that they often resolve SDN faults from an incomplete perspective which may result in side effects. More critically, as the SDN paradigm evolves, additional fault types are being exposed. Therefore, comprehensive reviews and constant improvements are required to remain on the leading edge of SDN fault management. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive and systematic survey of SDN faults and related management solutions identified through advancements in both the research community and industry. We apply a systematic classification of SDN faults, compare and analyze existing SDN fault management solutions in the literature, and conduct a gap analysis between solutions developed in an academic research context and practical deployments. The current challenges and emerging trends are also noted as potential future research directions. This paper aims to provide academic researchers and industrial engineers with a comprehensive survey with the hope of advancing SDN and inspiring new solutions.},

abstract={Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a kind of complex real-time hybrid system which involves deep interactions between computation processors, communication network, and physical environments are deemed as the key enablers of next generation computer applications. However, how to verify CPS effectively is always a great challenge. Based on current scientific works about CPS verification, this paper aims at identifying the gap of current studies and suggesting promising areas for the future works. For this purpose, we conduct a systematic mapping study over the topic on verification of cyber-physical system. We carry out a widely search of publications from 2006 to 2018 in 11 electronic databases. After the step of study selection, 80 papers are selected as primary studies for answering proposed research questions, focused questions, and statistical questions. According to these questions and their answers, this paper not only presents a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of verification challenges, abstraction methods, verification techniques, assistance tools, and verification scenarios that represent each step of verification works, but also summarizes CPS systematic natures, main routine of verification and future research directions. We believe that this survey can identify gaps in current research works and reveal new insights for the future works.},

abstract={Systematic exploration of hypotheses is a major part of any empirical research. In software engineering, we often produce unique tools for experiments and evaluate them independently on different data sets. In this paper, we present KernelHaven as an experimentation workbench supporting a significant number of experiments in the domain of static product line analysis and verification. It addresses the need for extracting information from a variety of artifacts in this domain by means of an open plug-in infrastructure. Available plug-ins encapsulate existing tools, which can now be combined efficiently to yield new analyses. As an experimentation workbench, it provides configuration-based definitions of experiments, their documentation, and technical services, like parallelization and caching. Hence, researchers can abstract from technical details and focus on the algorithmic core of their research problem. KernelHaven supports different types of analyses, like correctness checks, metrics, etc., in its specific domain. The concepts presented in this paper can also be transferred to support researchers of other software engineering domains. The infrastructure is available under Apache 2.0: https://github.com/KernelHaven. The plug-ins are available under their individual licenses.},

The aim is not so much to check the defined requirements but to ensure that the software satisfies the customer’s needs. Agile methodologies put stringent demands on UAT, if only for the frequency at which it needs to be conducted due to the iterative development of small product releases. In this setting, traditional in-person meetings might not scale up well. Complementary ways are needed to reduce the costs of developer-customer collaboration during UAT. This work introduces a wiki-based approach where customers and developers asynchronously collaborate: developers set the UAT scaffolding that will later shepherd customers when testing. To facilitate understanding, mind maps are used to represent UAT sessions. To facilitate engagement, a popular mind map editor, FreeMind, is turned into an editor for FitNesse, the wiki engine in which these ideas are borne out. The approach is evaluated through a case study involving three real customers. First evaluations are promising. Though at different levels of completeness, the three customers were able to complete a UAT. Customers valued asynchronicity, mind map structuredness, and the transparent generation of documentation out of the UAT session."

Objective
The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) through clinical, electrophysiological and morphological evaluation of the median nerve.
Methods
The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation through administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging with DTI, and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinaculum. Tractography was also performed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The degree of functional impairment was compared with the anatomical damage to the median nerve according to ENG and DTI.
Results
FA and ADC were significantly correlated with ENG parameters of CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the CTS patients were 0.359±0.06 and 1.866±0.050×10−3mm2/s, respectively, vs 0.59±0.014 and 1.395±0.035×10−3mm2/s, respectively, in the controls. FA was decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (P<0.05).
Conclusion
DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and ENG data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS."

The models are typically described using domain-specific languages and tools that are readily accessible to the domain experts. Consequently, domain experts, despite not having formal software engineering training, find themselves creating models (designs) from which code is generated, thus effectively contributing to the design and coding activities of software development. This new role for domain experts as software developers can have a direct impact on the system safety if the domain experts do not follow software engineering best practices. In this chapter, we describe our experiences as software engineers in multiyear collaborations with domain experts from the automotive industry, who are developing embedded software with the MBD approach. We provide guidelines that strengthen the collaboration between domain experts and software engineers and improve the quality, and hence safety, of embedded software systems developed using MBD. We clarify the role of some of the most commonly used software engineering principles and artefacts, while also addressing issues and misconceptions encountered in adopting software engineering practices in MBD. Although this chapter focuses on the MBD of automotive embedded software in Matlab Simulink, the guidelines we provide are applicable to the MBD of software in general."

Case–control studies related to our study theme were enrolled for meta-analysis and Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 (CMA 2.0) was used for statistical analysis. After treatment, DHEAS levels in depression patients were significantly increased, while before and after treatment, DHEAS levels were all lower in depression patients than in controls (all P<0.001); further analysis on age revealed that DHEAS levels were decreased with the rising of age. Meta-analysis results suggested that serum DHEAS levels (ng/mL) were significantly higher in healthy controls compared to depression patients (SMD=0.777, 95%CI=0.156–1.399, P=0.014). In conclusion, our study suggests that serum DHEAS levels are associated with the development of depression and it decreased with the rising of age."

abstract = "Objective
Given its role in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and cortisol to dihydrocortisol, 5α-reductase may be important in the pathophysiology of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Increased activity of this enzyme has already been demonstrated in ovaries of affected women, and might be caused by genetic alterations. The aim of this study was to analyze representative genetic variants of both isoforms of 5α-reductase with regard to PCOS parameters in lean and obese women.
Study design
We analyzed one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs523349) of the isoform 2 (SRD5A2) and one haplotype of the isoform 1 (SRD5A1), consisting of the two SNPs rs39848 and rs3797179, in 249 women with PCOS and 226 healthy women using a 5′-exonuclease-assay. The genotypes were associated with anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal as well as functional tests in these women.
Results
In the investigated haplotype of SRD5A1, the TA variant was associated with an increased frequency of PCOS (P=0.022) and an increased Ferriman–Gallwey Score (hirsutism) (P=0.016) in women with normal weight. The G allele at the examined position of the SRD5A2 showed a decreased frequency of PCOS (P=0.03) in women with normal weight.
Conclusion
One of the keys in the development of the PCOS is hyperandrogenism, which might be caused by an increased 5α-reductase activity, as it is often seen in obesity. This mechanism might therefore be of importance in lean PCOS patients and contribute to the clinical findings."

To define the syntax, semantics and notions of the DSML, the domain model of the STSAS from which we generalize the domain concepts and relationships among these concepts is given, and then, the domain model is mapped into a UML meta-model, named UML-STSAS profile.

Objective: The goal of this article is to better understand the characteristics of TBCG techniques and associated tools, identify research trends, and assess the importance of the role of MDE in this code synthesis approach. Method: We survey the literature to paint an interesting picture about the trends and uses of TBCG in research. To this end, we follow a systematic mapping study process. Results: Our study shows, among other observations, that the research community has been diversely using TBCG over the past 16 years. An important observation is that TBCG has greatly benefited from MDE. It has favored a template style that is output-based and high-level modeling languages as input. TBCG is mainly used to generate source code and has been applied to many domains. Conclusion: TBCG is now a mature technique and much research work is still conducted in this area. However, some issues remain to be addressed, such as support for template definition and assessment of the correctness and quality of the generated code."

Domain engineering aims at facilitating software development in an efficient and economical way. One way to measure that is through productivity indicators, which refer to the ability of creating a quality software product in a limited period and with limited resources. Many approaches have been devised to increase productivity; however, these approaches seem to suffer from a tension between expressiveness on the one hand, and applicability (or the lack of it) in providing guidance for developers.
Objective
This paper evaluates the applicability and efficiency of adopting a domain engineering approach, called Application-based DOmain Modeling (ADOM), in the context of the programming task with Java, and thus termed ADOM-Java, for improving productivity in terms of code quality and development time.
Method
To achieve that objective we have qualitatively evaluate the approach using questionnaires and following a text analysis procedure. We also set a controlled experiment in which 50 undergraduate students performed a Java-based programming task using either ADOM-Java or Java alone.
Results
The qualitative evaluation reveal that the approach is easy to uses and provides valuable guidance. Nevertheless, it requires training. The outcomes of the experiment indicate that the approach is applicable and that the students that used ADOM-Java achieved better code quality, as well as better functionality and within less time than the students who used only Java.
Conclusion
The results of the experiments imply that by providing a code base equipped with reuse guidelines for programmers can increase programming productivity in terms of quality and development time. These guidelines may also enforce coding standards and architectural design."

abstract = "In the development of web information systems, design tasks are commonly used in approaches for Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) to represent models. To generate fully implemented prototypes, these models require a rich representation of the semantics for actions (e.g., database persistence operations). In the development of some use case scenarios for the multi-layered development of web information systems, these design tasks may consume weeks of work even for experienced designers. The literature pointed out that the impossibility for executing a software project with short iterations hampers the adoption of some approaches for design in some contexts, such as start-up companies. A possible solution to introduce design tasks in short iterations is the use of automated design techniques, which assist the production of models by means of transformation tasks and refinements. This paper details our methodology for MDWE, which is supported by automated design techniques strictly associated with use case patterns of type CRUD. The novelty relies on iterations that are possible for execution with short time-scales. This is a benefit from automated design techniques not observed in MDWE approaches based on manual design tasks. We also report on previous experiences and address open questions relevant for the theory and practice of MDWE."

In an earlier study in 2004, our colleagues reported the results of an Alberta-wide regional survey of software testing techniques in practice. Five years after that first study, the authors felt it is time to replicate the survey and analyze what has changed and what not from 2004 to 2009. This study was conducted during the summer of 2009 by surveying software organizations in the Canadian province of Alberta. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about software testing practices in Alberta, and point out what has changed from 2004 to 2009 and what not. Note that although our study is conducted in the province of Alberta, we have compared the results to few international similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Turkey, Hong Kong and Australia, The study should thus be of interest to all testing professionals world-wide. Among the findings are the followings: (1) almost all companies perform unit and system testing with a slight increase since 2004, (2) automation of unit, integration and systems tests has increased sharply since 2004, (3) more organization are using observations and expert opinion to conduct usability testing, (4) the choices of test-case generation mechanisms have not changed much from 2004, (5) JUnit and IBM Rational tools are the most widely used test tools, (6) Alberta companies still face approximately the same defect-related economic issues as do companies in other jurisdictions, (7) Alberta software firms have improved their test automation capability since 2004, but there is still some room for improvement, and (8) compared to 2004, more companies are spending more effort on pre-release testing."

abstract = "Background
The circulating pool of estrone-sulfate is considered as a “reservoir” of slowly-metabolized estrogen that can be exploited for assessing overall individual estrogenicity. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay for the determination of estrone-sulfate, suitable for routine clinical investigations.
Methods
The proposed assay is based on a simple protein precipitation procedure and on a fast measurement with a triple–quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in negative ion mode and in multiple reaction monitoring. The method was assessed for intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy, recovery, and clinical suitability. A comparison with available radioimmunoassay was also performed.
Results
The LC–MS/MS method is able to detect estrone-sulfate concentrations ≤1pg/mL and has a low limit of quantification of 7.8pg/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were less than 10.5% and 5.0% respectively. The recovery was in the range of 93%–110%. When compared with radioimmunoassay the method resulted more accurate and therefore more suitable for quantifying the estrone-sulfate in different clinical settings, including patients treated with aromatase inhibitors.
Conclusions
The proposed LC–MS/MS method represents a convincing alternative to the immunoassay for a fast, cost-effective and reliable measurement of estrone-sulfate in routine clinical investigations and in large epidemiological studies. It may contribute in shedding a new light on the diagnostic value of estrone-sulfate in normal and pathological conditions."

In software development, Testing is an important mechanism both to identify defects and assure that completed products work as specified. This is a common practice in single-system development, and continues to hold in Software Product Lines (SPL). Even though extensive research has been done in the SPL Testing field, it is necessary to assess the current state of research and practice, in order to provide practitioners with evidence that enable fostering its further development.
Objective
This paper focuses on Testing in SPL and has the following goals: investigate state-of-the-art testing practices, synthesize available evidence, and identify gaps between required techniques and existing approaches, available in the literature.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of nine research questions, in which 120 studies, dated from 1993 to 2009, were evaluated.
Results
Although several aspects regarding testing have been covered by single-system development approaches, many cannot be directly applied in the SPL context due to specific issues. In addition, particular aspects regarding SPL are not covered by the existing SPL approaches, and when the aspects are covered, the literature just gives brief overviews. This scenario indicates that additional investigation, empirical and practical, should be performed.
Conclusion
The results can help to understand the needs in SPL Testing, by identifying points that still require additional investigation, since important aspects regarding particular points of software product lines have not been addressed yet."

Few effective approaches exist that can effectively tie these lower level models to a high level system model during design space exploration. This complicates the validation of high level system requirements during detailed design. In this paper, we define requirements for a high level model that is firstly driven by key systems engineering challenges present in industry and secondly connects to several formal and domain specific models used in model-based design. We analysed part of the systems engineering process at a company developing complex systems, by observing the design process and by analysing design documentation and development databases. By generalizing these observations, we identified several high level systems engineering challenges. They are compared to literature, focusing on reported systems engineering challenges and on existing approaches that incorporate high level models in model-based systems engineering. Finally, we argue that high level system models supporting design space exploration should be able to communicate information regarding design trade-offs (e.g. safety versus ease of use) effectively in a multidisciplinary setting. In our outlook, we propose how to continue our research, by recommending further research and defining a research question."

The only way to avoid these mistakes is to introduce redundancy in the software engineering process. This article is a plea to consciously introduce several levels of redundancy for each programming task. Depending on the required level of correctness, expressed in a residual error probability (typically 10−3 to 10−10), each programming task must be carried out redundantly 4 to 8 times. This number is hardly influenced by the size of a programming endeavour. Training software engineers do have some effect as non-trained software engineers require a double amount of redundant tasks to deliver software of a desired quality. More compact programming, for instance by using domain specific languages, only reduces the number of redundant tasks by a small constant."

To evaluate if a single blood flow restriction (BFR)-exercise bout would induce hypoalgaesia in patients with anterior knee pain (AKP) and allow painless application of therapeutic exercise.
Design
Cross-sectional repeated measures design.
Setting
Institutional out-patients physiotherapy clinic.
Patients
Convenience sample of 30 AKP patients.
Intervention
BFR was applied at 80% of complete vascular occlusion. Four sets of low-load open kinetic chain knee extensions were implemented using a pain monitoring model.
Main outcome measurements
Pain (0–10) was assessed immediately after BFR application and after a physiotherapy session (45 min) during shallow and deep single-leg squat (SSLS, DSLS), and step-down test (SDT). To estimate the patient rating of clinical effectiveness, previously described thresholds for pain change (≥40%) were used, with appropriate adjustments for baseline pain levels.
Results
Significant effects were found with greater pain relief immediate after BFR in SSLS (d = 0.61, p < 0.001), DSLS (d = 0.61, p < 0.001), and SDT (d = 0.60, p < 0.001). Time analysis revealed that pain reduction was sustained after the physiotherapy session for all tests (d(SSLS) = 0.60, d(DSLS) = 0.60, d(SDT) = 0.58, all p < 0.001). The reduction in pain effect size was found to be clinically significant in both post-BFR assessments.
Conclusion
A single BFR-exercise bout immediately reduced AKP with the effect sustained for at least 45 min."

For this project, it was crucial to discuss the requirements of the system with domain-experts at a high level of abstraction in order to elicit feedback so that the development could proceed at a fast pace and in the right direction. Furthermore, given time and resource constraints, we elected to use a model driven approach using automatic code generation coupled with high-productivity frameworks.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the pathway also critically regulates these events during placental development and differentiation. Herein, we summarize our present knowledge about Notch signalling in murine and human placentation and discuss its potential role in the pathophysiology of gestational disorders. Studies in mice suggest that Notch controls trophectoderm formation, decidualization, placental branching morphogenesis and endovascular trophoblast invasion. In humans, the particular signalling cascade promotes formation of the extravillous trophoblast lineage and regulates trophoblast proliferation, survival and differentiation. Expression patterns as well as functional analyses indicate distinct roles of Notch receptors in different trophoblast subtypes. Altered effects of Notch signalling have been detected in choriocarcinoma cells, consistent with its role in cancer development and progression. Moreover, deregulation of Notch signalling components were observed in pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. In summary, Notch plays fundamental roles in different developmental processes of the placenta. Abnormal signalling through this pathway could contribute to the pathogenesis of gestational diseases with aberrant placentation and trophoblast function."

Due to the rising complexity of the embedded functions, performance limitations and practicability reasons, the simulations are often specialized to test specific aspects of the embedded system and develop a high diversity by themselves. This diversity is difficult to manage for a user and results in erroneously selected test components and compatibility problems in the test configuration. This paper presents a generative programming approach that handles the diversity of test libraries. Compatibility issues are explicitly evaluated by a new interface concept. Furthermore, a novel model analyzer facilitates the efficient application in practice by migrating existing libraries. The approach is evaluated for an example from the automotive domain using MATLAB/Simulink."

abstract = "Context: Behavior Driven Development (BDD), widely used in modern software development, enables easy creation of acceptance test case specifications and serves as a communication basis between business- and technical-oriented stakeholders. BDD is largely facilitated through simple domain specific languages (DSL) and usually restricted to technical test domain concepts. Integrating business domain concepts to implement a ubiquitous language for all members of the development team is an appealing test language improvement issue. But the integration of business domain concepts into BDD toolkits has so far not been investigated. Objective: The objective of the study presented in this paper is to examine whether supporting the ubiquitous language features inside a DSL, by extending a DSL with business domain concepts, is beneficial over using a DSL without those concepts. In the context of the study, benefit is measured in terms of perceived quality, creation time and length of the created test case specifications. In addition, we analyze if participants feel supported when using predefined business domain concepts. Method: We investigate the creation of test case specifications, similar to BDD, in a controlled student experiment performed with graduate students based on a novel platform for DSL experimentation. The experiment was carried out by two groups, each solving a similar comparable test case, one with the simple DSL, the other one with the DSL that includes business domain concepts. A crossover design was chosen for evaluating the perceived quality of the resulting specifications. Results: Our experiment indicates that a business domain aware language allows significant faster creation of documents without lowering the perceived quality. Subjects felt better supported by the DSL with business concepts. Conclusion: Based on our findings we propose that existing BDD toolkits could be further improved by integrating business domain concepts."

The benchmark generation and performance data capture tool implementation (MDABench) is based on widely used open source MDA frameworks. The benchmark application is modeled in UML and generated by taking advantage of the existing community-maintained code generation “cartridges” so that current component technology can be exploited. We have also tailored the UML 2.0 Testing Profile so architects can model the performance testing and data collection architecture in a standards compatible way. We then extended the MDA framework to generate a load testing suite and automatic performance measurement infrastructure. This greatly reduces the effort and expertise needed for benchmarking with complex component and Web service technologies while being fully MDA standard compatible. The approach complements current model-based performance prediction and analysis methods by generating the benchmark application from the same application architecture that the performance models are derived from. We illustrate the approach using two case studies based on Enterprise JavaBean component technology and Web services."

It thus appears advantageous to write numerical computer codes which allow the user to define the problem and the quantities of interest directly in terms of operator strings, rather than in some low-level programming language. Here I describe a Mathematica package which provides a flexible framework for performing the required translations between several different representations of operator expressions: condensed notation using pure ASCII character strings, traditional notation (“pretty printing”), internal Mathematica representation using nested lists (used for automatic symbolic manipulations), and various higher-level (“macro”) expressions. The package consists of a collection of transformation rules that define the algebra of operators and a comprehensive library of utility functions. While the emphasis is given on the problems from solid-state and atomic physics, the package can be easily adapted to any given problem involving non-commuting operators. It can be used for educational and demonstration purposes, but also for direct calculations of problems of moderate size.

This chapter discusses several practical issues and techniques for adopting model-based testing. It starts with the prerequisites of model-based testing and then goes through taxonomy of the possible approaches with the goal of helping one to choose a good approach for one's needs. It deals with people and training issues and discusses how model based testing can fit into agile development processes and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) unified process. One benefit of model-based testing is that it identifies faults in the analysis model and in the requirements earlier in the design process than is usually the case. This can prevent those faults from flowing into the design model and the SUT implementation. This happens because the modeling and model-validation stages of model-based testing raise questions about the requirements and can expose faults well before any tests are executed."

There are some problems in this process, caused by contradictions and incompletenesses in the specification documents written in natural language, and misunderstanding between specialists in onboard systems, operational engineers, and programmers. In this paper, two practical examples of verification and online updating of spacecraft control logic are described. The approaches we used allow avoiding the mentioned problems. The theoretical basis for verification is Real-Time Control Algorithms Logic RTCAL. Using this, we have developed and successfully applied software tools and domain-specific languages used at the design and operational stages of spacecraft control.

The increasing inherent diversity of such large-scale variant-rich systems further complicates quality assurance. In this article, we present a combination of architecture-driven model-based testing principles and regression-inspired testing strategies for efficient, yet comprehensive variability-aware conformance testing of variant-rich systems. We propose an integrated delta-oriented architectural test modeling and testing approach for component as well as integration testing that allows the generation and reuse of test artifacts among different system variants. Furthermore, an automated derivation of retesting obligations based on accurate delta-oriented architectural change impact analysis is provided. Based on a formal conceptual framework that guarantees stable test coverage for every system variant, we present a sample implementation of our approach and an evaluation of the validity and efficiency by means of a case study from the automotive domain."

abstract = "Context
A distributed business process is executed in a distributed computing environment. The service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm is a popular option for the integration of software services and execution of distributed business processes. Entailment constraints, such as mutual exclusion and binding constraints, are important means to control process execution. Mutually exclusive tasks result from the division of powerful rights and responsibilities to prevent fraud and abuse. In contrast, binding constraints define that a subject who performed one task must also perform the corresponding bound task(s).
Objective
We aim to provide a model-driven approach for the specification and enforcement of task-based entailment constraints in distributed service-based business processes.
Method
Based on a generic metamodel, we define a domain-specific language (DSL) that maps the different modeling-level artifacts to the implementation-level. The DSL integrates elements from role-based access control (RBAC) with the tasks that are performed in a business process. Process definitions are annotated using the DSL, and our software platform uses automated model transformations to produce executable WS-BPEL specifications which enforce the entailment constraints. We evaluate the impact of constraint enforcement on runtime performance for five selected service-based processes from existing literature.
Results
Our evaluation demonstrates that the approach correctly enforces task-based entailment constraints at runtime. The performance experiments illustrate that the runtime enforcement operates with an overhead that scales well up to the order of several ten thousand logged invocations. Using our DSL annotations, the user-defined process definition remains declarative and clean of security enforcement code.
Conclusion
Our approach decouples the concerns of (non-technical) domain experts from technical details of entailment constraint enforcement. The developed framework integrates seamlessly with WS-BPEL and the Web services technology stack. Our prototype implementation shows the feasibility of the approach, and the evaluation points to future work and further performance optimizations."

Much research has been carried out to create cloud service registries to help users select cloud services for eventual consumption, especially within the field of semantic web services. Through analyzing real-world requirements of six use cases we identified a gap in research for user-centric technologies. We fill this gap by creating a business vocabulary reflecting common service selection criteria, defining a textual domain specific language to let any user describe services easily, and implementing a novel brokering and matchmaking component to support users in their selection process. As a combination of those technologies, we create the Open Service Compendium (OSC), a crowd-sourced cloud service registry. Our evaluation activities highlight how these developments solve real-world challenges in diverse near-production settings. All of this implies that a substantial benefit for service registry users can be created by following a simple architecture that is focused on their concrete needs — instead of aiming for highest sophistication and broadest applicability as observed in many of the related works."

This community may be created around the wiki itself (e.g., community of contributors in Wikipedia) or already exist (e.g., company employees in corporate wikis). In the latter case, the wiki is not created in a vacuum but as part of the information ecosystem of the hosting organization. As any other Information System resource, wiki success highly depends on the interplay of technology, work practice and the organization. Thus, wiki contributions should be framed along the concerns already in use in the hosting organization in terms of glossaries, schedules, policies, organigrams and the like. The question is then, how can corporate strategies permeate wiki construction while preserving wiki openness and accessibility? We advocate for the use of “Wiki Scaffoldings”, i.e., a wiki installation that is provided at the onset to mimic these corporate concerns: categories, users, templates, articles initialized with boilerplate text, are all introduced in the wiki before any contribution is made. To retain wikis' friendliness and engage layman participation, we propose scaffoldings to be described as mind maps. Mind maps are next “exported” as wiki installations. We show the feasibility of the approach introducing a Wiki Scaffolding Language (WSL). WSL is realized as a plugin for FreeMind, a popular tool for mind mapping. Finally, we validate the expressiveness of WSL in four case studies. WSL is available for download."

While such integration can be relatively straightforward for a single instance – that is, the integration of a specific knowledge resource in a specific clinical information system – the challenge lies in the fact that both knowledge resources and clinical information systems are quite diverse. Consequently, there is no single knowledge integration architecture that can address all circumstances. However, there are several architectural patterns for knowledge integration that can, taken together, enable the effective integration of knowledge resources into applications. The primary purpose of this chapter, then, is to outline the main CDS knowledge integration architectures that are available and to detail the pros and cons of each approach. The appropriateness of a given architecture for a particular organization depends on a variety of factors, including the existing clinical information system infrastructure and the type of CDS capability involved (e.g. real-time vs. non-real-time applications. These various approaches are outlined here, with special attention being placed on knowledge integration architectures aligned with broad trends in the IT landscape, such as service-oriented architectures, cloud-based computing, and app-based software ecosystems. The chapter also discusses how CDS architectures must align with larger changes in the health care industry as a whole, as shifting health care reimbursement models are requiring continuity of care across multiple organizations and health IT systems centered around patients and populations rather than care episodes at individual care settings."

abstract = "Context
It is an enigma that agile projects can succeed ‘without requirements’ when weak requirements engineering is a known cause for project failures. While agile development projects often manage well without extensive requirements test cases are commonly viewed as requirements and detailed requirements are documented as test cases.
Objective
We have investigated this agile practice of using test cases as requirements to understand how test cases can support the main requirements activities, and how this practice varies.
Method
We performed an iterative case study at three companies and collected data through 14 interviews and two focus groups.
Results
The use of test cases as requirements poses both benefits and challenges when eliciting, validating, verifying, and managing requirements, and when used as a documented agreement. We have identified five variants of the test-cases-as-requirements practice, namely de facto, behaviour-driven, story-test driven, stand-alone strict and stand-alone manual for which the application of the practice varies concerning the time frame of requirements documentation, the requirements format, the extent to which the test cases are a machine executable specification and the use of tools which provide specific support for the practice of using test cases as requirements.
Conclusions
The findings provide empirical insight into how agile development projects manage and communicate requirements. The identified variants of the practice of using test cases as requirements can be used to perform in-depth investigations into agile requirements engineering. Practitioners can use the provided recommendations as a guide in designing and improving their agile requirements practices based on project characteristics such as number of stakeholders and rate of change."

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) allow for the building of applications that ease the labour of both software engineers and domain experts thanks to the level of abstraction they provide. In cases where the domain is restricted to Client-Side Web Applications (CSWA), XML-based languages, frameworks and widgets are commonly combined in order to provide fast, robust and flexible solutions. This article presents an approach designed to create XML-based DSL solutions for CSWA that includes an evaluation engine, a programming model and a lightweight development environment. The approach is able to evaluate multiple XML-based DSL programs simultaneously to provide solutions to those Domain Specific Problems for CSWAs. To better demonstrate the capabilities and potential of this novel approach, we will employ a couple of case studies, namely Anisha and FeedPsi."

We also present an Eclipse-based development tool that supports a BDD approach for developing fUML components. The tool provides developers a concrete syntax for defining executable scenarios, and automatically updates the project status based on verified delivered behaviorus."

abstract = "Context
Gamification has been proven to increase engagement and motivation in multiple and different non-game contexts such as healthcare, education, workplace, and marketing, among others. However, many of these applications fail to achieve the desired benefits of gamification, mainly because of a poor design.
Objective
This paper explores the conceptualization, implementation and monitoring phases of meaningful gamification strategies and proposes a solution for strategy experts that hides the implementation details and helps them focus only on what is crucial for the success of the strategy. The solution makes use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology.
Method
An easy-to-use graphical editor is used to provide the high-level models that represent the design of the gamification strategy and its deployment and monitoring. These models contain the event pattern definitions to be automatically transformed into code. This code is then deployed both in a CEP engine to detect the conditions expressed in such patterns and in an enterprise service bus to execute the corresponding pattern actions.
Results
The paper reports on the use of both a graphical modeling editor for gamification domain definition and a graphical modeling editor for gamification strategy design, monitoring and code generation in event-based systems. It also shows how the proposal can be used to design and automate the implementation and monitoring of a gamification strategy in an educational domain supported by a well-known Learning Management System (LMS) such as Moodle.
Conclusion
It can be concluded that this unprecedented model-driven approach leveraging gamification and CEP technology provides strategy experts with the ability to graphically define gamification strategies, which can be directly transformed into code executable by event-based systems. Therefore, this is a novel solution for bringing CEP closer to any strategy expert, positively influencing the gamification strategy design, implementation and real-time monitoring processes."

The web has had a significant impact on all aspects of our society. As our society relies more and more on the web, the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software applications. Our literature search for related studies retrieved 193 papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared between 2000 and 2013.
Objective
As this research area matures and the number of related papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends and empirical evidence in this specialized field.
Methods
We systematically review the body of knowledge related to functional testing of web application through a systematic literature review (SLR) study. This SLR is a follow-up and complimentary study to a recent systematic mapping (SM) study that we conducted in this area. As part of this study, we pose three sets of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and synthesize the empirical evidence in this area.
Results
Our pool of studies includes a set of 95 papers (from the 193 retrieved papers) published in the area of web application testing between 2000 and 2013. The data extracted during our SLR study is available through a publicly-accessible online repository. Among our results are the followings: (1) the list of test tools in this area and their capabilities, (2) the types of test models and fault models proposed in this domain, (3) the way the empirical studies in this area have been designed and reported, and (4) the state of empirical evidence and industrial relevance.
Conclusion
We discuss the emerging trends in web application testing, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our SLR can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing web application testing approaches, fault models, tools, metrics and empirical evidence, and subsequently identify areas in the field that require more attention from the research community."

To study the problems faced during quality assurance and certification activities, a case study was performed on legacy software used for thermal analysis of a fuelpin in a nuclear reactor. Although no errors were uncovered in the code, 27 issues of incompleteness and inconsistency were found with the documentation. This work proposes that software documentation follow a rational process, which includes a software requirements specification following a template that is reusable, maintainable, and understandable. To develop the design and implementation, this paper suggests literate programming as an alternative to traditional structured programming. Literate programming allows for documenting of numerical algorithms and code together in what is termed the literate programmer's manual. This manual is developed with explicit traceability to the software requirements specification. The traceability between the theory, numerical algorithms, and implementation facilitates achieving completeness and consistency, as well as simplifies the process of verification and the associated certification."

Extensive efforts have been made to immunoisolate these islets by introducing barriers on the islet surface. To date, these barriers have not successfully protected islets from attack by the immune system. In addition, the inevitable permeability of an islet capsule cannot prevent filtration by proinflammatory cytokines and islet self-antigens. Thus, we have developed a surface engineering approach for localized immonumodulation of the islet microenvironment. Jagged-1 (JAG-1), as a potent immunomodulatory factor, was immobilized on the islet surface by mediation of a double-layer of heterobifunctional poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). Immobilization and functionality of JAG-1 on PEGylated islet surfaces were established. When co-cultured with splenocytes, the JAG-1 conjugated islets induced a significant increase in regulatory T cells and regulated the cytokine levels produced by immune cells. The results demonstrated that JAG-1 immobilization could improve immunoprotection of pancreatic islets by localized modulation of the immune milieu from an inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. We also evaluated the effects of surface modification of these islets by JAG-1 in a xenotransplantation model. The transplanted JAG-1/PEG/islets group showed a significantly reduced blood glucose levels compared with the control group of diabetic mice during the acute phase of the immune response to the transplanted islets. Our results demonstrated that surface modification has the potential to shift the immune system from an inflammatory to anti-inflammatory milieu and may offer a new prospective for immunoprotection of pancreatic islets."

Our method is based on formal models in a dedicated intermediate representation, compiled directly from mixed scores (high-level requirements), and either passed, to the model-checker Uppaal (after conversion to Timed Automata) in the offline approach, or executed by a virtual machine in the online approach. Our fully automatic framework has been applied to real mixed scores used in concerts and the results obtained have permitted to identify bugs in the target IMS."

Such the systems are expected to have the attributes of reliability, availability, safety, confidentiality, survivability, integrity, and maintainability. Current software and hardware systems continue to evolve in complexity at rapid rates. Although the increase in the complexity of single artifact (such as number of logical decision points in a software package) can often be tracked with Moore's Law like approximations, systems constructed out of larger number of smaller subsystems defy such classifications. The reason for this added complexity is that interactions between the subsystems explode exponentially in the size of the parent system. Yet all component interactions must be addressed exhaustively to predict accurate behavior of the whole system. The challenge that we face is that it is seldom possible to model or test all such interactions in a given system. As a result, building dependable complex systems with realistic assessment of risks of failure is an extremely difficult endeavor. Attempts have been made to ameliorate the difficulty in the engineering of dependable complex systems using lessons from engineering methodologies in other domains. We discuss key attributes of dependable complex systems, with a special emphasis on security where information is involved. We review classical approaches to designing, building, and maintaining dependable complex systems. We present promising features and novel ideas applicable to the lifecycle of dependable complex systems. Most of our discussion is focused within the domain of hardware and software systems. Over time, practitioners in dependable engineering have learned lessons from previous experience and continue to present prescriptive approaches discovered through research and analysis. These lessons and approaches are often applicable to other engineering domains such as construction, transportation, and industrial control. We look at specific engineering challenges and proposed solutions pertaining to the following general domains, with occasional examples from any branch of engineering:•dependable hardware/software systems;•secure dependable systems;•dependable cloud infrastructure and applications. Finally, we conclude with the observation that several approaches are applicable across all these domains and identify accessible techniques that have good potential to increase the dependability of systems. These approaches can be considered as axiomatic in building any future complex systems with a high degree of dependability."

In model-based software development, bidirectional model transformation (BX) provides a fundamental solution to model synchronization that can retain the consistency among models. Similar to conventional programs, a BX program may also contain bugs. Accordingly, a BX program must be tested prior to being used in practice. A challenging problem of testing BX programs is to construct test oracles (e.g., assertions and expected output models), which are usually difficult and/or expensive to manually specify.
Objective
In we paper, we investigate how to alleviate the oracle problem in BX testing via reducing the costs of developing test oracles.

We propose a metamorphic testing approach for BX. First, we identify three generic metamorphic relations for BX. Afterwards, we define a metamodel MT4MT to establish metamorphic test groups and test scripts. We also propose a testing framework to support metamorphic testing based on MT4MT.
Results
We conducted an experimental study of mutation analysis and a case study on three ATL-based ad-hoc BXs. The results of the experimental study and the case study showed that our approach killed 79.38% mutants and enabled us to test real-world ATL-based ad-hoc BXs. We also demonstrated that MT4MT can be used to test the semantics properties of BXs.
Conclusion
Our approach is an effective and practical approach with lower costs of developing test oracles."

Moreover, maintaining efficient traceability, integration, and communication between two fundamental system life cycle phases (design time and runtime) is another challenge requiring the scalability of MDE. This paper presents an overview of the ECSEL 11http://www.ecsel-ju.eu/web/index.php. project entitled “MegaModelling at runtime – Scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems” (MegaM@Rt2), whose aim is to address the above mentioned challenges facing MDE.

Diverse industrial use cases (covering strategic domains such as aeronautics, railway, construction and telecommunications) will integrate and demonstrate the validity of the MegaM@Rt2 solution.

The language, called PTL (Prolog based Transformation Language), can be considered as a hybrid language in which ATL (Atlas Transformation Language)-style rules are combined with logic rules for defining transformations. ATL-style rules are used to define mappings from source models to target models while logic rules are used as helpers. The implementation of PTL is based on the encoding of the ATL-style rules by Prolog rules. Thus, PTL makes use of Prolog as a transformation engine. We have provided a declarative semantics to PTL and proved the semantics equivalent to the encoded program. We have studied an encoding of OCL (Object Constraint Language) with Prolog goals in order to map ATL to PTL. Thus a subset of PTL can be considered equivalent to a subset of ATL. The proposed language can be also used for model validation, that is, for checking constraints on models and transformations. We have equipped our language with debugging and tracing capabilities which help developers to detect programming errors in PTL rules. Additionally, we have developed an Eclipse plugin for editing PTL programs, as well as for debugging, tracing and validation. Finally, we have evaluated the language with several transformation examples as well as tested the performance with large models."

In this paper, we propose a notation that aims to combine the benefits of visual and text-based approaches.

In our evaluation based on real models, we identify problematic model shapes challenging the scalability our notation, while finding that it is well-suited to capture typical test models."

abstract = "Context
The paper addresses the use of a Software Product Line approach in the context of developing software for a high-integrity, regulated domain such as civil aerospace. The success of a Software Product Line approach must be judged on whether useful products can be developed more effectively (lower cost, reduced schedule) than with traditional single-system approaches. When developing products for regulated domains, the usefulness of the product is critically dependent on the ability of the development process to provide approval evidence for scrutiny by the regulating authority.
Objective
The objective of the work described is to propose a framework for arguing that a product instantiated using a Software Product Line approach can be approved and used within a regulated domain, such that the development cost of that product would be less than if it had been developed in isolation.
Method
The paper identifies and surveys the issues relating the adoption of Software Product Lines as currently understood (including related technologies such as feature modelling, component-based development and model transformation) when applied to high-integrity software development. We develop an argument framework using Goal Structuring Notation to structure the claims made and the evidence required to support the approval of an instantiated product in such domains. Any unsubstantiated claims or missing/sub-standard evidence is identified, and we propose potential approaches or pose research questions to help address this.
Results
The paper provides an argument framework supporting the use of a Software Product Line approach within a high-integrity regulated domain. It shows how lifecycle evidence can be collected, managed and used to credibly support a regulatory approval process, and provides a detailed example showing how claims regarding model transformation may be supported. Any attempt to use a Software Product Line approach in a regulated domain will need to provide evidence to support their approach in accordance with the argument outlined in the paper.
Conclusion
Product Line practices may complicate the generation of convincing evidence for approval of instantiated products, but it is possible to define a credible Trusted Product Line approach."

Model-based safety analysis techniques use formal methods to rigorously assess the risks associated with safety-critical systems.

This paper shows how S# facilitates and improves model simulation, debugging, and testing during all stages of the development of such systems."

The state of the art method to produce acyl-ACPs involves the transfer of a phosphopantetheine moiety from CoA to apo-ACP by E. coli holo-ACP synthase (EcACPS), yielding holo-ACP which subsequently becomes thioesterified with free fatty acids by the E. coli acyl-ACP synthase (EcAAS). Alternatively, acyl-ACPs can be synthesized by direct transfer of acylated phosphopantetheine moieties from acyl-CoA to apo-ACP by means of EcACPS. The need for native substrates to characterize the FAS-II enzymes of P. falciparum prompted us to investigate the potential and limit of the two methods to efficiently acylate P. falciparum ACP (PfACP) with respect to chain length and β-modification and in preparative amounts. The EcAAS activity is found to be independent from the oxidation state at the β-position and accepts fatty acids as substrates with chain lengths starting from C8 to C20, whereas EcACPS accepts very efficiently acyl-CoAs with chain lengths up to C16, and with decreasing activity also longer chains (C18 to C20). Methods were developed to synthesize and purify preparative amounts of high quality natural substrates that are fully functional for the enzymes of the P. falciparum FAS-II system."

Although more advanced variations may incorporate an advanced search algorithm to cover difficult scenarios, many decisions still have to be made randomly simply because no information is available to calculate the best decision. Because of this, many of the generated sequences may be redundant, while some others may be rare and hard to get. This paper presents a rich formalism that is based on a mix of algebraic relations and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to query test suites, and an efficient algorithm to execute such queries. Queries can be used as correctness specifications (oracles) to validate a test suite. They are however more general as they can be used to filter out test sequences with interesting properties, e.g. to archive them for future use. The proposed formalism is quite expressive: it can express algebraic equations with logical variables, Hoare triples, class invariants, as well as their temporal modalities. An evaluation of the query algorithm’s performance is included in this paper. The whole query framework has been implemented in a testing tool for Java called T3i."

Automated test generation promises to improve the effectiveness of software testing and to reduce the involved manual effort. While automated test generation has been successfully applied for code-level API testing, it has not found widespread adoption in practice for testing of graphical user interfaces. Tools for test generation do not support GUI testing out-of-the-box but require dedicated extensions.
Objective
This paper explores the applicability of automated test generation for testing GUIs of industry applications. We propose a test adapter approach to bridge the gap between automated test generation tools and industry applications.
Method
A multiple case study was conducted in which automated test generation with test adapters has been applied at the unit, integration, and system test level in three industry projects from two different companies.
Results
Automated test generation via test adapters could be applied at all test levels. It has led to an increase of coverage as well as the detection of new defects that were not found by preceding testing activities in the projects. While test adapters can easily be implemented at the unit test level, their complexity and the corresponding effort for providing adapter implementations rises at higher test levels.
Conclusion
Test adapters can be used for applying automated test generation for testing GUIs of industry applications. They bridge the gap between automated test generation tools and industry applications. The development of test adapters requires no tool-specific knowledge and can be performed by members of the development team."

This chapter describes the metrics and measurements pertinent to the wireless LAN (WLAN) Medium Access Control (MAC), as well as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) stack. A functional test is concerned with verifying that a device or system functions properly. A performance test is much more broad-based and generic, and is aimed at characterizing a device or system according to some well-defined metric. Indeed, a single performance metric may be applicable to a wide variety of devices. WLAN protocol tests, almost without exception, inject packet traffic into the device under test (DUT) as test stimuli, and measure the DUT response in terms of the number or rate of specific types of packets that it generates in turn. As tests are being performed on the MAC layer, the RF characteristics of the packet traffic are rarely of much interest, beyond ensuring that these characteristics do not skew the test results by causing unexpected issues at the physical (PHY) layer. Conformance tests are almost exclusively performed in a highly controlled and isolated environment, as external interference at the wrong moment can invalidate an entire test. It is found that IEEE 802.11 protocol conformance tests are performed on the different aspects of the WLAN-MAC and PHY protocol specifications."

Finally, the business rules or technical constraints that define the space of possible configurations can be relatively complex and also subject to frequent changes. This makes acquiring and encoding domain knowledge as well as testing and debugging particularly demanding tasks.

Effects are indispensable in code generators, whether to report failures or to insert let-statements and if-guards. Extensive painful experience shows that unrestricted effects interact with generated binders in undesirable ways to produce unexpectedly unbound variables, or worse, unexpectedly bound ones. These subtleties hinder domain experts in using and extending the generator. A pressing problem is thus to express the desired effects while regulating them so that the generated code is correct, or at least correctly scoped, by construction. We present a code-combinator framework that lets us express arbitrary monadic effects, including mutable references and delimited control, that move open code across generated binders. The static types of our generator expressions not only ensure that a well-typed generator produces well-typed and well-scoped code. They also express the lexical scopes of generated binders and prevent mixing up variables with different scopes. For the first time ever we demonstrate statically safe and well-scoped loop interchange and constant factoring from arbitrarily nested loops. Our framework is implemented as a Haskell library that embeds an extensible typed higher-order domain-specific language. It may be regarded as ‘staged Haskell.’ To become practical, the library relies on higher-order abstract syntax and polymorphism over generated type environments, and is written in a mature language."

Feature location in the context of software families, which is key for software product line adoption, is a research field that is becoming more mature with a high proliferation of techniques. Objective: We present EFLBench, a benchmark and a framework to provide a common ground for the evaluation of feature location techniques in families of systems. Method: EFLBench leverages the efforts made by the Eclipse Community which provides feature-based family artefacts and their plugin-based implementations. Eclipse is an active and non-trivial project and thus, it establishes an unbiased ground truth which is realistic and challenging. Results: EFLBench is publicly available and supports all tasks for feature location techniques integration, benchmark construction and benchmark usage. We demonstrate its usage, simplicity and reproducibility by comparing four techniques in Eclipse releases. As an extension of our previously published work, we consider a decade of Eclipse releases and we also contribute an approach to automatically generate synthetic Eclipse variants to benchmark feature location techniques in tailored settings. We present and discuss three strategies for this automatic generation and we present the results using different settings. Conclusion: EFLBench is a contribution to foster the research in feature location in families of systems providing a common framework and a set of baseline techniques and results."

An asset management system helps the plant to drive the operational and maintenance excellence. There are various systems developed for various applications; they together as a suite help to monitor, analyze, predict, and report the asset performance. This chapter deals with plant asset management systems, instrument asset management systems (IAMS), and some of the key rendering technologies and standards. The key drivers for the deployment of such systems and role-based access to the systems are discussed at length. Some of the communication technologies mentioned in this chapter are dealt separately as individual chapters. At the end of the topic, the key features from the asset management systems from an instrumentation perspective are dealt in much more length with little overview on enterprise asset management systems. Some of the rendering technologies such as DD/EDDL and FDT are discussed in more detail for the instrumentation engineers to get more familiar with these technologies and hence help them to choose the same selectively, considering the needs of the plants. The plant asset management systems and the modeling and underlying benefits of such systems are also discussed to create awareness on the possibilities of asset management in a plant context extending the limits from instrumentation and control to assets such as pumps, electrical machinery, and rotating equipment."

These proposals have been classified generically as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and share common concepts and terms that need to be abstracted, discussed and understood. This paper presents a survey on MDE based on a unified conceptual model that clearly identifies and relates these essential concepts, namely the concepts of system, model, metamodel, modeling language, transformations, software platform, and software product. In addition, this paper discusses the terminologies relating MDE, MDD, MDA and others. This survey is based on earlier work, however, contrary to those, it intends to give a simple, broader and integrated view of the essential concepts and respective terminology commonly involved in the MDE, answering to key questions such as: What is a model? What is the relation between a model and a metamodel? What are the key facets of a modeling language? How can I use models in the context of a software development process? What are the relations between models and source code artefacts and software platforms? and What are the relations between MDE, MDD, MDA and other MD approaches?"

abstract = "Context
It is challenging to develop comprehensive, consistent, analyzable requirements models for evolving requirements. This is particularly critical for certain highly interactive types of socio-technical systems that involve a wide range of stakeholders with disparate backgrounds; system success is often dependent on how well local social constraints are addressed in system design.
Objective
This paper describes feasibility research, combining a holistic social system perspective provided by Activity Theory (AT), a psychological paradigm, with existing system development methodologies and tools, specifically goal and scenario modeling.
Method
AT is used to understand the relationships between a system, its stakeholders, and the system’s evolving context. The User Requirements Notation (URN) is used to produce rigorous, analyzable specifications combining goal and scenario models. First, an AT language was developed constraining the framework for automation, second consistency heuristics were developed for constructing and analyzing combined AT/URN models, third a combined AT/URN methodology was developed, and consequently applied to a proof-of-concept system.
Results
An AT language with limited tool support was developed, as was a combined AT/URN methodology. This methodology was applied to an evolving disease management system to demonstrate the feasibility of adapting AT for use in system development with existing methodologies and tools. Bi-directional transformations between the languages allow proposed changes in system design to be propagated to AT models for use in stakeholder discussions regarding system evolution.
Conclusions
The AT framework can be constrained for use in requirements elicitation and combined with URN tools to provide system designs that include social system perspectives. The developed AT/URN methodology can help engineers to track the impact on system design due to requirement changes triggered by changes in the system’s social context. The methodology also allows engineers to assess the impact of proposed system design changes on the social elements of the system context."

abstract = "Context: Metamodels evolve over time to accommodate new features, improve existing designs, and fix errors identified in previous releases. One of the obstacles that may limit the adaptation of new metamodels by developers is the extensive manual changes that have been applied to migrate existing models. Recent studies addressed the problem of automating the metamodel/model co-evolution based on manually defined migration rules. The definition of these rules requires the list of changes at the metamodel level which are difficult to fully identify. Furthermore, different possible alternatives may be available to translate a metamodel change to a model change. Thus, it is hard to generalize these co-evolution rules. Objective: We propose an alternative automated approach for the metamodel/model co-evolution. The proposed approach refines an initial model instantiated from the previous metamodel version to make it as conformant as possible to the new metamodel version by finding the best compromise between three objectives, namely minimizing (i) the non-conformities with new metamodel version, (ii) the changes to existing models, and (iii) the textual and structural dissimilarities between the initial and revised models. Method: We formulated the metamodel/model co-evolution as a multi-objective optimization problem to handle the different conflicting objectives using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Results: We evaluated our approach on several evolution scenarios extracted from different widely used metamodels. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach with average manual correctness, precision and recall respectively higher than 91%, 88% and 89% on the different co-evolution scenarios. Conclusion: A comparison with our previous work confirms the out-performance of our multi-objective formulation."

In vivo analysis of murine polyomavirus (MPyV) infection has shown that subtle alterations in PyV–glycan interactions alone can result in dramatic changes in pathogenicity, implying that similar effects will be found for other PyVs. Our discussion will review the assays used for determining virus–glycan binding, and how these relate to known PyV tropism and pathogenesis."

One distinguished feature of such complex interactions is the tight coupling between discrete and continuous interactions, captured by hybrid system models. Due to the complexity of CPSs, providing rigorous and model-based analysis methods and tools for verifying correctness of such systems is of the utmost importance. Model-based testing (MBT) is one such verification technique that can be used for checking the conformance of an implementation of a system to its specification (model). In this chapter, we first review the main concepts and techniques in MBT. Subsequently, we review the most common modeling formalisms for CPSs, with focus on hybrid system models. Subsequently, we provide a brief overview of conformance relations and conformance testing techniques for CPSs."

Hence, unless the process is handled carefully, adding fault tolerance may even lead to a less reliable system. As a way to deal with the inherently high level of complexity of fault-tolerant systems, some research groups have turned to the paradigm of model-driven engineering. This results in a research field that crosscuts the established fields of software engineering, system verification, fault-tolerant systems and distributed systems. Many works are presented in the context of one of these traditional fields, making it difficult to get a good overview of what is presently offered. We survey 10 approaches for model-driven engineering of reliable fault-tolerant systems and present 13 characteristics classifying the approaches in a manner useful for both users and developers of such approaches. We further discuss the state of the field and what the future may bring."

Commonly, there is little reuse of existing frameworks beyond the development teams and not much sharing of science components across frameworks. We believe this must change to enable researchers and assessors to form complex workflows that leverage the current environmental science available.

abstract = "Context
Software product lines (SPLs) and Agile are approaches that share similar objectives. The main difference is the way in which these objectives are met. Typically evidence on what activities of Agile and SPL can be combined and how they can be integrated stems from different research methods performed separately. The generalizability of this evidence is low, as the research topic is still relatively new and previous studies have been conducted using only one research method.
Objective
This study aims to increase understanding of Agile SPL and improve the generalizability of the identified evidence through the use of a multi-method approach.
Method
Our multi-method research combines three complementary methods (Mapping Study, Case Study and Expert Opinion) to consolidate the evidence.
Results
This combination results in 23 findings that provide evidence on how Agile and SPL could be combined.
Conclusion
Although multi-method research is time consuming and requires a high degree of effort to plan, design, and perform, it helps to increase the understanding on Agile SPL and leads to more generalizable evidence. The findings confirm a synergy between Agile and SPL and serve to improve the body of evidence in Agile SPL. When researchers and practitioners develop new Agile SPL approaches, it will be important to consider these synergies."

While developing a model by extension, executing similar simulation experiments to those performed with the original model reveals important behavioral insights into the extended model. An automatic generation and execution of these simulation experiments can provide valuable support in the process of developing models. A prerequisite is an explicit specification of simulation experiments. Therefore, we annotate models with simulation experiments that are specified in a declarative domain specific language SESSL (Simulation Experiment Specification via a Scala Layer). Based on experiment specifications of the original model, we introduce a mechanism to automatically generate and execute simulation experiments for the extended model with necessary adaptations. Furthermore, as we experiment with stochastic models, we exploit statistical model checking and specify the expected model behavioral properties, against which the simulation results are checked. Thereby, when a model is extended, the original experiment specifications are reused, adapted, and applied to the extended model. Accordingly, the generated simulation trajectories are probed to check whether the expected properties hold with a certain probability or not. Thus, more fast and frequent feedback during model development can be provided to the modeler. Based on a model of membrane related dynamics, we show how the developed approach can be used in successively extending models."

However, there are scarce tools and methods supporting their Validation and Verification (V&V), which are essential activities for the proper engineering of meta-models. In order to fill this gap, we propose two complementary meta-model V&V languages. The first one has similar philosophy to the xUnit framework, as it enables the definition of meta-model unit test suites comprising model fragments and assertions on their (in-)correctness. The second one is directed to express and verify expected properties of a meta-model, including domain and design properties, quality criteria and platform-specific requirements. As a proof of concept, we have developed tooling for both languages in the Eclipse platform, and illustrate its use within an example-driven approach for meta-model construction. The expressiveness of our languages is demonstrated by their application to build a library of meta-model quality issues, which has been evaluated over the ATL zoo of meta-models and some OMG specifications. The results show that integrated support for meta-model V&V (as the one we propose here) is urgently needed in meta-modelling environments."

The DSML of a framework is built by identifying the features of this framework and the information required to instantiate them. Application generators transform models created with the DSML into application code, hiding framework complexities.

  abstract      = {A considerable part of the behavior in smart environments relies on event-driven and rule specification. Rules are the mechanism most often used to enable user customization of the environment. However, the expressiveness of the rules available to users in editing and other tools is usually either limited or the available rule editing interfaces are not designed for end-users with low skills in programming. This means we have to look for interaction techniques and new ways to define user customization rules. This paper describes a generic and flexible meta-model to support expressive rules enhanced with data flow expressions that will graphically support the definition of rules without writing code. An empirical study was conducted on the ease of understanding of the visual data flow expressions, which are the key elements in our rule proposal. The visual dataflow language was compared to its corresponding textual version in terms of comprehension and ease of learning by teenagers in exercises involving calculations, modifications, writing and detecting equivalences in expressions in both languages. Although the subjects had some previous experience in editing mathematical expressions on spreadsheets, the study found their performance with visual dataflows to be significantly better in calculation and modification exercises. This makes our dataflow approach a promising mechanism for expressing user-customized reactive behavior in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. The performance of the rule matching processor was validated by means of two stress tests to ensure that the meta-model approach adopted would be able to scale up with the number of types and instances in the space.},

In this paper, we propose an extension to BDDs, referred to as OR-BDDs, that enables the accurate modelling of the circuit structure in a compact manner. We show how to construct the minimal OR-BDDs. We introduce the fault model for OR-BDDs and show it's one-to-one correspondence with the structural stuck-at-value model. Finally, we present an algorithm for test pattern generation that uses OR-BDDs and their fault model. This algorithm discovers efficiently circuit redundancy and enables 100% fault coverage for all detectable faults by a compact set of test vectors.},

RESULTS: The systematic mapping study includes 50 primary studies published between 2001 and 2014. An in-depth analysis of the primary studies revealed ten recurrent themes that characterize continuous deployment and provide researchers with directions for future work. In addition, a set of benefits and challenges of which practitioners may take advantage were identified.

As discussed at the outset of this chapter, companies often turn to the research organizations, the vendors, or both. However, the vendors are clearly self-interested, and the research organizations receive much of their funding from the vendors and are not articulating a comprehensive vision for how IT enablement tooling must interoperate. Hence, this chapter. Enablement tools and architectures are important and must be given their due. This chapter has several goals. First, it discusses the generic categories of internal IT enablement systems and potential interactions and overlaps. One issue in particular in this area is the proliferation of single-point systems. Providing a framework to support such efforts is a primary goal of this chapter. Finally, the use of a common logical process and data model can assist in the integration of the vendor packages available, and in particular the master data subjects be clearly established with defined systems of record so that the diverse systems can be aligned.},

A formal representation of the VHDL process statement is described and the concept of event-driven simulation and its impact on test generation are discussed using the formal representation. The new test generation method generates realistic tests by ignoring the sensitivity list of a process statement and identifying the type of the behavior described by the statements inside the process statement (two types of behavior - synchronous and asynchronous, are defined.). A systematic way of converting a VHDL model to one suitable for checking the validity of the generated tests is presented. A method of further compacting the generated tests is also presented. Finally, an approach to generating tests in the presence of different types of bus resolution functions is discussed.},

Precisely specifying a computational transformation requires well-defined semantics of the source and target representations. In this regard, continuous-time behavior is an essential aspect of time-based block diagrams that is typically approximated by numerical integration. The corresponding theory, however, is mostly concerned with local error and the mathematical semantics of long time behavior fails to be sufficiently precise from a computational perspective. In this work, first a computational semantics is developed based on a multi-stage variablestep solver. Next, the computational semantics of the discrete and continuous parts of hybrid systems and their interaction are formalized in a unifying framework. The framework exploits a successful functional approach to defining discrete-time and discrete-event behavior established in other work. Unification is then achieved by developing a computational representation of the continuous-time behavior as pure functions on streams.},

Nanoparticles of tacrolimus (FK506) might interact with human SP-A, which is the most abundant lipoprotein in the alveolar fluid. This study was undertaken to determine whether the formation of FK506/SP-A complexes interferes with FK506 immunosuppressive actions on stimulated human macrophage-like U937 cells. We found that SP-A was avidly bound to FK506 (Kd=35±4nM), as determined by solid phase–binding assays and dynamic light scattering. Free FK506, at concentrations ⩽1μM, had no effect on the inflammatory response of LPS-stimulated U937 macrophages. However, coincubation of FK506 and SP-A, at concentrations where each component alone did not affect LPS-stimulated macrophage response, significantly inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation and TNF-alpha secretion. Free FK506, but not FK506/SP-A, functioned as substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. FK506 bound to SP-A was delivered to macrophages by endocytosis, since several endocytosis inhibitors blocked FK506/SP-A anti-inflammatory effects. This process depended partly on SP-A binding to its receptor, SP-R210. These results indicate that FK506/SP-A complexes have a greater anti-inflammatory effect than either FK506 or SP-A alone and suggest that SP-A strengthened FK506 anti-inflammatory activity by facilitating FK506 entrance into the cell, overcoming P-glycoprotein.},

First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.},

  abstract      = {Cyber-physical systems combine a cyber side (computing and networking) with a physical side (mechanical, electrical, and chemical processes). In many cases, the cyber component controls the physical side using sensors and actuators that observe the physical system and actuate the controls. Such systems present the biggest challenges as well as the biggest opportunities in several large industries, including electronics, energy, automotive, defense and aerospace, telecommunications, instrumentation, industrial automation. Engineers today do successfully design cyber-physical systems in a variety of industries. Unfortunately, the development of systems is costly, and development schedules are difficult to stick to. The complexity of cyber-physical systems, and particularly the increased performance that is offered from interconnecting what in the past have been separate systems, increases the design and verification challenges. As the complexity of these systems increases, our inability to rigorously model the interactions between the physical and the cyber sides creates serious vulnerabilities. Systems become unsafe, with disastrous inexplicable failures that could not have been predicted. Distributed control of multi-scale complex systems is largely an unsolved problem. A common view that is emerging in research programs in Europe and the US is “enabling contract-based design (CBD),” which formulates a broad and aggressive scope to address urgent needs in the systems industry. We present a design methodology and a few examples in controller design whereby contract-based design can be merged with platform-based design to formulate the design process as a meet-in-the-middle approach, where design requirements are implemented in a subsequent refinement process using as much as possible elements from a library of available components. Contracts are formalizations of the conditions for correctness of element integration (horizontal contracts), for lower level of abstraction to be consistent with the higher ones, and for abstractions of available components to be faithful representations of the actual parts (vertical contracts).},

This chapter explains the semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) overview, business environment, sourcing products, evaluating business models, product enablers, licensing products, and the provider and buyer perspectives. SIP has existed since the advent of the semiconductor industry. SIP business practices include elements similar to those found in the traditional semiconductor or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), electronic design automation (EDA), and design services markets. Outsourcing is unlikely if the SIP product is seen by the potential buyer as a core competency or a key differentiator in its product, or if its use requires third-party access to the buyer's patents or trade secrets. SIP License Agreements may require a significant effort depending upon the business objectives of the parties, the intended use of the SIP Product, the nature of the SIP product, and the risks associated with using the SIP product in the end application. The scope of license, warranty, indemnity, and limitation of liability provisions usually consume the majority of the effort in negotiating an SIP License Agreement. However, IC developers are finding more low-cost solutions at their fingertips, and the semiconductor supply chain has become increasingly stratified.},

Each member of this family, called a profile, can be used to formalize architectural decisions at a given stage of the development process. An ACL profile is composed of a core constraint language, which is shared with the other profiles, and a MOF architecture metamodel. In addition to this family of languages, this paper introduces a transformation-based interpretation method of profiles and its associated tool.},

Reusing a design pattern is not always in the favor of developers. Thus, the code starts smelling. The presence of “Code Smells” leads to more difficulties for the developers. This racket of code smells is sometimes called Anti-Patterns.
Objective
The paper aimed at a systematic literature review of refactoring with respect to code smells. However the review of refactoring is done in general and the identification of code smells and anti-patterns is performed in depth.
Method
A systematic literature survey has been performed on 238 research items that includes articles from leading Conferences, Workshops and premier journals, theses of researchers and book chapters.
Results
Several data sets and tools for performing refactoring have been revealed under the specified research questions.
Conclusion
The work done in the paper is an addition to prior systematic literature surveys. With the study of paper the attentiveness of readers about code smells and anti-patterns will be enhanced.},

Although the cost-effective software engineering of WSbWAs is potentially a very rewarding area, not much work has been done to accomplish short time to market conditions by viewing and dealing with WSbWAs as software products that can be derived from a common infrastructure and assets with a captured specific abstraction in the domain. Both Product Line Engineering (PLE) and Agile Methods (AMs), albeit with different philosophies, are software engineering approaches that can significantly shorten the time to market and increase the quality of products. Using the PLE approach we built, at the domain engineering level, a WSbWA-specific lightweight product-line architecture and combined it, at the application engineering level, with an Agile Method that uses a domain-specific visual language with direct manipulation and extraction capabilities of web services to perform customization and calibration of a product or WSBWA for a specific customer. To assess the effectiveness of our approach we designed and implemented a tool that we used to investigate the return on investment of the activities related to PLE and AMs. Details of our proposed approach, the related tool developed, and the experimental study performed are presented in this article together with a discussion of planned directions of future work.},

  abstract      = {Context
Large-scale distributed systems are becoming commonplace with the large popularity of peer-to-peer and cloud computing. The increasing importance of these systems contrasts with the lack of integrated solutions to build trustworthy software. A key concern of any large-scale distributed system is the validation of global properties, which cannot be evaluated on a single node. Thus, it is necessary to gather data from distributed nodes and to aggregate these data into a global view. This turns out to be very challenging because of the system’s dynamism that imposes very frequent changes in local values that affect global properties. This implies that the global view has to be frequently updated to ensure an accurate validation of global properties.
Objective
In this paper, we present a model-based approach to define a dynamic oracle for checking global properties. Our objective is to abstract relevant aspects of such systems into models. These models are updated at runtime, by monitoring the corresponding distributed system.
Method
We conduce real-scale experimental validation to evaluate the ability of our approach to check global properties. In this validation, we apply our approach to test two open-source implementations of distributed hash tables. The experiments are deployed on two clusters of 32 nodes.
Results
The experiments reveal an important defect on one implementation and show clear performance differences between the two implementations. The defect would not be detected without a global view of the system.
Conclusion
Testing global properties on distributed software consists of gathering data from different nodes and building a global view of the system, where properties are validated. This process requires a distributed test architecture and tools for representing and validating global properties. Model-based techniques are an expressive mean for building oracles that validate global properties on distributed systems.},

At the heart of this new approach lies a single page interaction model that facilitates rich interactivity. Also push-based solutions from the distributed systems are being adopted on the web for ajax applications. The field is, however, characterized by the lack of a coherent and precisely described set of architectural concepts. As a consequence, it is rather difficult to understand, assess, and compare the existing approaches. We have studied and experimented with several ajax frameworks trying to understand their architectural properties. In this paper, we summarize four of these frameworks and examine their properties and introduce the spiar architectural style which captures the essence of ajax applications. We describe the guiding software engineering principles and the constraints chosen to induce the desired properties. The style emphasizes user interface component development, intermediary delta-communication between client/server components, and push-based event notification of state changes through the components, to improve a number of properties such as user interactivity, user-perceived latency, data coherence, and ease of development. In addition, we use the concepts and principles to discuss various open issues in ajax frameworks and application development.},

In contrast, both male and female red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are highly aggressive in both the breeding and non-breeding seasons in defense of food stores on their individual territories throughout the boreal and northern forests of North America. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an androgen precursor, is secreted from the adrenal cortex in some mammals, and DHEA has been linked to aggression in non-breeding songbirds. Here, we examined plasma DHEA levels in a natural population of red squirrels in the Yukon, Canada. Plasma DHEA levels in both males and females reached high concentrations (up to 16.952ng/ml in males and 14.602ng/ml in females), markedly exceeding plasma DHEA concentrations in laboratory rats and mice and similar to plasma DHEA concentrations in some primates. Circulating DHEA levels showed both seasonal and yearly variation. Seasonal variation in male plasma DHEA levels was negatively correlated with testes mass. Yearly variation in male DHEA levels was positively correlated with population density. In both males and females, circulating DHEA rapidly increased after ACTH treatment, implying an adrenal origin. This is the first examination of plasma DHEA concentrations in a wild rodent and the first field experiment on the regulation of plasma DHEA in any wild mammal. These data lay the foundation for future studies on the role of DHEA in non-breeding territoriality in this species and other mammals.},

We examined the effects of photoperiod on aggressive behavior in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), which do not display reproductive responsiveness to short days. As expected, short days had no effect on plasma testosterone. Estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta immunostaining did not differ in the lateral septum, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, or medial amygdala. However, males housed in short days were significantly more aggressive than males housed in long days. Similar to previous work in beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus), estradiol rapidly increased aggression when male California mice were housed in short days but not when housed in long days. These data suggest that the effects of photoperiod on aggression and estrogen signaling are independent of reproductive responses. The rapid action of estradiol on aggression in short-day mice also suggests that nongenomic mechanisms mediate the effects of estrogens in short days.},

This chapter presents an analysis of the principal engineering and economic issues that have emerged as telephone companies consider rewiring the nation's residences with fiber optics. Assuming significant future reductions in component costs, running fiber optic to the home is likely to remain more expensive than copper, where current loop plant costs are roughly $920 per subscriber. To realize the introduction of a fiber Integrated Broadband Networks (IBN), it must be justified on the basis of additional revenue producing services, such as the delivery of entertainment video. Fiber optic network capable of providing both voice and video services to the home can be constructed for $1800 to $2500 per home passed. Future developments in microelectronics, lasers, photodetectors, and powering architectures will greatly influence the economics of network evolution.},

There is an immediate industrial need to bridge the gap between such a sequence agnostic model and a standardized model verifier so that model checking can be performed in the requirement analysis phase itself. In this paper, we first spell out the Naive Algorithm that generates all possible finite state models corresponding to a given i* model. The growth of the finite state model space can be mapped to the problem of finding the number of possible paths between the Least Upper Bound (LUB) and the Greatest Lower Bound (GLB) of a k-dimensional hypercube lattice structure. The mathematics for doing a quantitative analysis of the space growth has also been presented. The Naive Algorithm has its main drawback in the hyperexponential growth of the model space. The Semantic Implosion Algorithm is proposed as a solution to the hyperexponential problem. This algorithm exploits the temporal information embedded within the i* model of an enterprise to reduce the rate of growth of the finite state model space. A comparative quantitative analysis between the two approaches concludes the superiority of the Semantic Implosion Algorithm.},

  abstract      = {Model transformations are key elements of model driven engineering. Current challenges for transformation languages include improving usability (i.e., succinct means to express the transformation intent) and devising powerful analysis methods. In this paper, we show how backwards reasoning helps in both respects. The reasoning is based on a method that, given an OCL expression and a transformation rule, calculates a constraint that is satisfiable before the rule application if and only if the original OCL expression is satisfiable afterwards. With this method we can improve the usability of the rule execution process by automatically deriving suitable application conditions for a rule (or rule sequence) to guarantee that applying that rule does not break any integrity constraint (e.g. meta-model constraints). When combined with model finders, this method facilitates the validation, verification, testing and diagnosis of transformations, and we show several applications for both in-place and exogenous transformations.},

  abstract      = {Plasma testosterone can play an important role in promoting aggressive behaviors relating to territory defense in breeding male birds. Some birds defend territories also during the non-breeding phase, when testosterone circulates at basal levels. In such species, plasma levels of the pro-hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may support non-breeding territoriality by acting as a local substrate for sex steroids. To test this possible role of plasma DHEA, we examined the seasonal DHEA profile of male (and female) European nuthatches Sitta europaea: a male and female nuthatch pair will defend an all-purpose territory throughout the year. We hypothesized that plasma DHEA would be detectable in wintering nuthatches with a territory. However, only ca. half of the territorial wintering males (and females) displayed detectable DHEA levels, suggesting that plasma DHEA is not a major sex steroid precursor during non-breeding. Further, among hatching-year birds, plasma DHEA was significantly lower in territorial birds than in “floaters”, i.e., subordinate birds without a territory. To experimentally examine the role of DHEA in non-breeding territoriality, we treated adult wintering males with DHEA and measured effects on aggressive responses to conspecific challenge. DHEA treatment elevated plasma levels of DHEA (and testosterone), but did not enhance territorial behaviors or their persistence. Taken together, our data suggest that DHEA (and, indeed, sex steroids per se) do not regulate non-breeding territoriality in the nuthatch. Given that territorial aggression in nuthatches is expressed year-round, a hormone for its activation may be redundant.},

  abstract      = {In patients undergoing coronary surgery, the uptake of amino acids, which has been shown to correlate with oxygen consumption, is a mechanism of cardiac adaptation to the iatrogenic ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with cardioplegic arrest. Based on these premises, we sought to determine whether oral supplementation with mixed amino acids may protect the rat heart exposed to ischemia-reperfusion and to address whether this hypothesized cardioprotection is achieved, at least in part, through preservation of the energy-producing properties of mitochondria. Sprague–Dawley rats were fed (by enteral route) a liquid diet, with or without mixed essential amino acids (daily dose of 1 g/kg) for 30 days. Hearts from anesthetized rats were perfused by the Langendorff method and randomized to 3 groups. The control group was perfused with buffer for 60 minutes; the ischemia-reperfusion control and the amino acid–treated groups were exposed to 35 minutes of ischemia, followed by 60 or 120 minutes of reperfusion. Amino acid supplements minimized infarct size (22 ± 1.8% vs 33 ± 2.5%; p <0.05) and occurrence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, as assessed by co-localization of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3–positive staining (p <0.01). Long-term treatment with amino acids also reduced the proportion of cardiomyocytes exhibiting immunostaining for cleaved caspase-9 (p <0.01) but was ineffective on processing of caspase-8. Similar results were obtained in the whole heart by caspase activity assays (p <0.01). The lessened activation of caspase-9 detected in amino acid-treated hearts paralleled a strong reduction in mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and rate of ATP production in isolated mitochondria were reduced by >75% in control hearts after 2 hours of reperfusion (p <0.05 vs control hearts); these values returned toward those of the control group in hearts supplemented with amino acids (p <0.01). Finally, the oxygen consumption rate in myocardial skinned bundles was markedly reduced in ischemia-reperfusion control hearts and almost normalized in amino acid-treated hearts (approximately 20% and 93% of the value for normoxic hearts; p <0.01). These results suggest that oral amino acid supplementation attenuates the extent of ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat heart, through preservation of the mitochondria-generated production of high-energy phosphates.},

Nowadays, a large number of important services – for instance e-commerce, healthcare and many others – depend on the availability of the underlying network. Clearly, service interruptions due to network problems may have a severe impact. On the long way towards the Future Internet, the complexity will grow even further. Therefore, new ideas and concepts must be evaluated thoroughly, and particularly in realistic, real-world Internet scenarios, before they can be deployed for production networks. For this purpose, various testbeds – for instance PlanetLab, GpENI or G-Lab – have been established and are intensively used for research. However, all of these testbeds lack the support for so-called multi-homing. Multi-homing denotes the connection of a site to multiple Internet service providers, in order to achieve redundancy. Clearly, with the need for network availability, there is a steadily growing demand for multi-homing. The idea of the NorNet Core project is to establish a Future Internet research testbed with multi-homed sites, in order to allow researchers to perform experiments with multi-homed systems. Particular use cases for this testbed include realistic experiments in the areas of multi-path routing, load balancing, multi-path transport protocols, overlay networks and network resilience. In this paper, we introduce the NorNet Core testbed as well as its architecture.},

This paper takes a software-centered interpretation of the ISO 42010 notion of architecture, enhancing it with a component model that attributes separate concerns to distinct design views. The component boundary becomes the border between functional and extra-functional concerns. The latter are treated as decorations placed on the outside of components, satisfied by implementation artifacts separate from and composable with the implementation of the component internals. The approach was evaluated by industrial users from several domains, with remarkably positive results.},

First, we introduce the area and explain the reasons why the software development industry begun to move into this direction in the late 1990s. Section 2 characterizes the research trends on Agile software development. This section helps understand the relevance of Agile software development in the research literature. Section 3 provides a walk through the roots of Agile and Lean thinking, as they originally emerged in manufacturing. Section 4 develops into Agile and Lean for software development. Main characteristics and most popular methods and practices of Agile and Lean software development are developed in this section. Section 5 centers on rapid releases, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, the latest advances in the area to get speed. The concepts of DevOps, as a means to take full (end-to-end) advantage of Agile and Lean, and Lean start-up, as an approach to foster innovation, are the focus of the two following 6 DevOps, 7 The Lean Startup Movement. Finally, Section 8 focuses on two important aspects of Agile and Lean software development: (1) metrics to guide decision making and (2) technical debt as a mechanism to gain business advantage.

The case study presented in this chapter concentrates on a two-phase discussion of model-driven modernization. To deal with the myriad of technological combinations found in modernization roadmaps, model-driven approaches, and tools offer the requisite abstraction level to build up mature and flexible modernization solutions. This chapter presents the initial collaboration between AtlanMod and Sodifrance, which led to a model-driven legacy modernization approach. The use of model-driven technologies on major migration projects has proven the benefit of this approach. Based on metamodeling standards, the tools used to extract the knowledge from existing applications, to transform the knowledge into new paradigms and architecture, and to regenerate the application according to specific technical platforms and patterns are more flexible and reusable. The new MoDisco platform brings all these benefits into an open extensible framework containing model-driven, reverse-engineering tools and components. The current process and tools used by Sodifrance on its modernization projects are elaborated in the discussion. An illustration drawn from a real migration project carried out for Amadeus Hospitality is also included. A new Eclipse initiative capitalizing on this experience to deliver a model-driven platform for the development of legacy modernization tools is presented.},

  abstract      = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) is an iterative and incremental software development process. Supporting the analysis and the verification of software systems developed following the MDE paradigm requires to adopt incrementality when carrying out these crucial tasks in a more optimized way. Communicating state machines are one of the various formalisms used in MDE tools to model and describe the behavior of distributed, concurrent, and real-time reactive systems (e.g., automotive and avionics systems). Modeling the overall behavior of such systems is carried out in a modular way and on different levels of abstraction (i.e., it starts with modeling the behavior of the individual objects in the system first then modeling the interaction between these objects). Similarly, analyzing and verifying the correctness of the developed models to ensure their quality and their integrity is performed on two main levels. The intralevel is used to analyze the correctness of the individual models in isolation of the others, while the interlevel is used to analyze the overall interoperability of those that are communicating with each other. One way to facilitate the analysis of the overall behavior of a system of communicating state machines is to build the global state space (also known as the global reachability tree) of the system. This process is very expensive and in some cases it may suffer from the state explosion problem. Symbolic execution is a technique that can be used to construct an abstract and a bounded version of the system global state space that is known as a symbolic execution tree (SET), yet the size of the generated trees can be very large especially with big and complex systems that are composed of multiple objects. As the system evolves, one way to avoid regenerating the entire SET and repeating any SET-based analyses that have been already conducted is to utilize the previous SET and its analysis results in optimizing the process of generating the SET of the system after the change. In this chapter, we propose two optimization techniques to direct the successive runs of the symbolic execution technique toward the impacted parts of an evolving state machine model using memoization (MSE) and dependency analysis (DSE), respectively. The evaluation results of both techniques showed significant reduction in some cases compared with the standard symbolic execution technique.},

Surveys have shown that for many projects, software maintenance consumes the majority of the overall software life-cycle costs, and there are indications that the proportion is increasing. Inability to cope with software maintenance can also result in a backlog of application modifications. Despite the importance of software maintenance, it has acquired the reputation of being a second-class area in which to work. The paper defines in more detail the term software maintenance, and then addresses the issues of maintaining existing code, and producing maintainable systems, stressing the role of reengineering. Three projects that focus on software maintenance are then summarized. All three aim to provide automated assistance to the software maintainer, but in contrasting ways. The ReForm project is based on a formal method to extract specifications from code using transformations. MACS and REDO are both transnational European projects funded by the Esprit collaborative programme of research; the former uses expert system technology to assist the maintainer, while REDO aims to provide a set of integratable tools within a single environment, to support the reverse engineering process.},

  abstract      = {Understanding the types of software engineering (SE) practices and techniques used in industry is important. There is a wide spectrum in terms of the types and maturity of SE practices conducted in industry. Turkey has a vibrant software industry and it is important to characterize and understand the state of its SE practices. Our objective is to characterize and grasp a high-level view on type of SE practices in the Turkish software industry. To achieve this objective, we systematically designed an online survey with 46 questions based on our past experience in the Canadian and Turkish contexts and using the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Two hundred and two practicing software engineers from the Turkish software industry participated in the survey. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about SE practices in Turkey and beyond. They also help track the profession of SE, and suggest areas for improved training, education and research. Among the findings are the followings: (1) The military and defense software sectors are quite prominent in Turkey, especially in the capital Ankara region, and many SE practitioners work for those companies. (2) 54% of the participants reported not using any software size measurement methods, while 33% mentioned that they have measured lines of code (LOC). (3) In terms of effort, after the development phase (on average, 31% of overall project effort), software testing, requirements, design and maintenance phases come next and have similar average values (14%, 12%, 12% and 11% respectively). (4) Respondents experience the most challenge in the requirements phase. (5) Waterfall, as a rather old but still widely used lifecycle model, is the model that more than half of the respondents (53%) use. The next most preferred lifecycle models are incremental and Agile/lean development models with usage rates of 38% and 34%, respectively. (6) The Waterfall and Agile methodologies have slight negative correlations, denoting that if one is used in a company, the other will less likely to be used. The results of our survey will be of interest to SE professionals both in Turkey and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in SE industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry–academia collaborations in those areas.},

  abstract      = {Background/Aims
The contribution of oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is still poorly elucidated. This study investigated the relationship between oxidative stress, insulin resistance, steatosis and fibrosis in CHC.
Methods
IgG against malondialdehyde-albumin adducts and HOMA-IR were measured as markers of oxidative stress and insulin resistance, respectively, in 107 consecutive CHC patients.
Results
Oxidative stress was present in 61% of the patients, irrespective of age, gender, viral load, BMI, aminotransferase level, histology activity index (HAI) and HCV genotype. Insulin resistance and steatosis were evident in 80% and 70% of the patients, respectively. In the patients infected by HCV genotype non-3, but not in those with genotype 3 infection HOMA-IR (p<0.03), steatosis (p=0.02) and fibrosis (p<0.05) were higher in the subjects with oxidative stress than in those without. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, HOMA-IR (p<0.01), fibrosis (p<0.01) and oxidative stress (p<0.05) were independently associated with steatosis, whereas steatosis was independently associated with oxidative stress (p<0.03) and HOMA-IR (p<0.02). Steatosis (p<0.02) and HAI (p=0.007) were also independent predictors of fibrosis.
Conclusions
In patients infected by HCV genotype non-3, oxidative stress and insulin resistance contribute to steatosis, which in turn exacerbates both insulin resistance and oxidative stress and accelerates the progression of fibrosis.},

Users want to be able to customize software behavior through reference to terms familiar to their diverse needs and experience. We present a requirements-driven approach to behavioral customization of software systems. Goal models are constructed to represent alternative behaviors that users can exhibit to achieve their goals. Customization information is then added to restrict the space of possibilities to those that fit specific users, contexts, or situations. Meanwhile, elements of the goal models are mapped to units of source code. This way, customization preferences posed at the requirements level are directly translated into system customizations. Our approach, which we apply to an on-line shopping cart system and an automated teller machine simulator, does not assume adoption of a particular development methodology, platform, or variability implementation technique and keeps the reasoning computation overhead from interfering with the execution of the configured application.},

This in turn enables the construction of a scalable, data-parallel parsing algorithm, which is presented in this work. Such an algorithm is easily amenable to be automatically generated via a parser generator tool, which was realized, and is also presented in the following. Furthermore, to complete the framework of a parallel input analysis, a parallel scanner can also combined with the parser. To prove the practicality of a parallel lexing and parsing approach, we report the results of the adaptation of JSON and Lua to a form fit for parallel parsing (i.e. an operator-precedence grammar) through simple grammar changes and scanning transformations. The approach is validated with performance figures from both high performance and embedded multicore platforms, obtained analyzing real-world inputs as a test-bench. The results show that our approach matches or dominates the performances of production-grade LR parsers in sequential execution, and achieves significant speedups and good scaling on multi-core machines. The work is concluded by a broad and critical survey of the past work on parallel parsing and future directions on the integration with semantic analysis and incremental parsing.},

Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are abundant in the sensillar lymph of insect antennae and participate in olfactory perireceptor events, such as transport of the hydrophobic odorant through the aqueous medium, presentation of the odor to olfactory receptors, and deactivation of the signal. This chapter describes the biochemistry and molecular biology of pheromone detection in the noctuid moth, Mamestra brassicae. The OBPs are diverse ranging from numerous species of several insect orders including Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Phasmatodea. Classification defines OBP-Type 1 and OBP-Type 2 based on phylogeny, tissue localization, and structural features. The advantage of the functional approach to characterize the diversity of OBPs inside species is characterized. The construction of EST antennal libraries with a high EST number to be representative of the sequence diversity has identified not only new OBPs, but also SAPs, pheromone-degrading enzymes, sensory-neuron-membrane-protein-like sequences, and other elements involved in the pheromone transduction process.},

This study aims to target and control Notch signaling by ligands immobilization using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as model surfaces. Non-fouling substrates were prepared by immersion of gold substrates in (1-Mercapto-11-undecyl)tetra(ethylene glycol) thiol solutions. These surfaces were activated with N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) at different concentrations (0, 0.03, 0.3, 3 and 30mg/ml) and an anti-human IgG, Fc specific fragment antibody (Ab) was covalently bound to EG4-SAMs to guarantee the correct exposure of the Notch ligand Jagged-1/Fc chimera (Jag-1). The presence of Ab and Jag-1 was confirmed by radiolabeling, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ellipsometry and ELISA. The biological activity of Jag-1-Ab-SAMs was assessed by real-time PCR for Hes-1 family gene expression, a Notch pathway target gene, in HL-60 cell line. Results have shown an increase of the amount of immobilized Ab with increasing surface activator concentrations. Jag-1 concentration also increases with Ab concentration. Interestingly, a higher Jagged-1 exposure and fold increase in Hes-1 expression were obtained for surfaces activated with the lowest concentration of CDI (0.03mg/ml). These results illustrate the great importance of ligands orientation and exposure, when compared with density. This investigation brings new insights into Notch signaling mechanisms. In particular, Jag-1-Ab-SAMs have shown to be adequate model surfaces to study Notch pathway activation and may provide a basis to develop new interfaces in biomaterials to control Notch mechanism in different cell systems.},

  abstract      = {Milk oligosaccharides (OS)—free complex carbohydrates—confer unique health benefits to the nursing neonate. Though human digestive enzymes cannot degrade these sugars, they provide nourishment to specific commensal microbes and act as decoys to prevent the adhesion of pathogenic micro-organisms to gastrointestinal cells. At present, the limited quantities of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) impede research on these molecules and their potential applications in functional food formulations. Considerable progress has been made in the study of OS structures; however, the synthetic pathways leading to their synthesis in the mammary gland are poorly understood. Recent studies show that complex OS with fucose and N-acetyl neuraminic acid (key structural elements of HMO bioactivity) exist in goat milk. Polymorphisms in the CSN1S1 locus, which is responsible for synthesis of αs1-casein, affect lipid and casein micelle structure in goat milk. The present study sought to determine whether CSN1S1 polymorphisms also influence goat milk oligosaccharide (GMO) production and secretion. The GMO compositions of thirty-two goat milk samples, half of which were from genotype A/A (αs1-casein producers) and half from genotype O/O (αs1-casein non-producers), were determined with nanoflow liquid chromatography high-accuracy mass spectrometry. This study represents the most exhaustive characterization of GMO to date. A systematic and comprehensive GMO library was created, consolidating information available in the literature with the new findings. Nearly 30 GMO, 11 of which were novel, were confirmed via tandem mass spectrometric analyses. Six fucosylated OS were identified; 4 of these matched HMO compositions and three were identified for the first time in goat milk. Importantly, multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the OS profiles of the A/A and O/O genotype milks could be discriminated by the fucosylated OS. Quantitative analysis revealed that the goat milk samples contained 1.17g/L of OS; however, their concentration in milks from A/A and O/O genotypes was not different. This study provides evidence of a genetic influence on specific OS biosynthesis but not total OS production. The presence of fucosylated GMO suggests that goat milk represents a potential source of bioactive milk OS suitable as a functional food ingredient.},

  abstract      = {Context
Continuous experimentation guides development activities based on data collected on a subset of online users on a new experimental version of the software. It includes practices such as canary releases, gradual rollouts, dark launches, or A/B testing.
Objective
Unfortunately, our knowledge of continuous experimentation is currently primarily based on well-known and outspoken industrial leaders. To assess the actual state of practice in continuous experimentation, we conducted a mixed-method empirical study.
Method
In our empirical study consisting of four steps, we interviewed 31 developers or release engineers, and performed a survey that attracted 187 complete responses. We analyzed the resulting data using statistical analysis and open coding.
Results
Our results lead to several conclusions: (1) from a software architecture perspective, continuous experimentation is especially enabled by architectures that foster independently deployable services, such as microservices-based architectures; (2) from a developer perspective, experiments require extensive monitoring and analytics to discover runtime problems, consequently leading to developer on call policies and influencing the role and skill sets required by developers; and (3) from a process perspective, many organizations conduct experiments based on intuition rather than clear guidelines and robust statistics.
Conclusion
Our findings show that more principled and structured approaches for release decision making are needed, striving for highly automated, systematic, and data- and hypothesis-driven deployment and experimentation.},

We first present a comparison of the available AOP tools for legacy C code bases, and then argue on our choice of Aspicere, our own AOP implementation for C. Then, we report on Aspicere’s application in reverse engineering a legacy industrial software system and we show how we apply a dynamic analysis to regain insight into the system. AOP is used for instrumenting the system and for gathering the data. This approach works and is conceptually very clean, but comes with a major quid pro quo: integration of AOP tools with the build system proves an important issue. This leads to the question of how to reconcile the notion of modular reasoning within traditional build systems with a programming paradigm which breaks this notion.},

To remedy the resulting software failures and faults, we first formalized the requirements by designing an W3C XML Schema for the precise definition of the requirements structure. The schema allows a highly structured representation of the essential information in eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Second, to offer the requirements engineers the ability to edit the XML documents in a friendly way while preserving their information structure, we developed a custom editor called XLEdit. Third, by developing a converter from MS Word to the target XML format, we helped the requirements engineers to migrate the existing business rules. Fourth, we developed translators from the structured requirements to schema languages, which enabled automated generation of message-validation code. The increase in customer satisfaction and clearinghouse-service efficiency are primary gains from the investment in the technology for structured requirements editing and validation.},

Ten dependent ICT utilization and expenditure factors are posited to be related to 12 independent demographic, economic, infrastructure, education, innovation and openness factors. The relationship of the independent to dependent factors is moderated by analysis of spatial patterns of technology utilization to examine proximities and reduce spatial bias. Based on the model, a multivariate analysis identifies correlates of the nation׳s digital divide, including patents registered by Japanese citizens, newspaper circulation, students and pupils per capita, household expenditures on education, rural/urban status, and Japan׳s aged population structure which has wide generational gaps. Spatial clusters and outliers of ICTs in prefectures are analyzed, with attention to their policy impacts. Findings suggest modifications to the conceptual model. Implications of findings for the country׳s official national technology planning policies are considered and recommendations made to expand them.},

A prevalent view has been that Rb-mediated transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling activities act in the VPCs to antagonize Ras activation through effects on promoters of target genes of the EGF receptor-Ras-MAP kinase pathway that promote vulval fates. Here, we have investigated the cellular focus of lin-35 using conventional genetic mosaic analysis and tissue-specific expression. Our results indicate that lin-35 activity is required in the major hypodermal syncytium and not in the VPCs to inhibit vulval fates. LIN-35 Rb may inhibit vulval fates by regulating a signal from hyp7 to the VPCs or the physiological state of hyp7.},

This paper proposes a TaaS system based on Adaptive Reasoning (AR) and Test Algebra (TA) for Combinatorial Testing (CT). AR performs testing and identifies faulty interactions, and TA eliminates related configurations from testing and there can be carried out concurrently. By combining these two, it is possible to perform large CT that were not possible before. Specifically, we performed experiments with 250 components with 2.83*1087 6-way interactions with about 21.1×1015 configurations, and this may be the largest CT experimentation as 2014. 98.6% of configurations have been eliminated out of total number of configurations.},

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is often associated with a decrease of the concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and an increase of IGFBP-1 and -2. Many investigators have studied the relationship between the GH-IGF-I system and some of the most common characteristics of disease progression, such as decreased CD4 cell counts, weight loss and fat redistribution. Although conditions for restoration of thymic function and lymphopoiesis with GH or IGF-I are still not well defined, many studies led to the development of clinical trials on the therapeutic use of GH, IGF-I and GHRH for the treatment of weight loss or fat redistribution, two problems which persist despite the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Monitoring IGF-I concentrations during treatment with GH and GHRH is likely to become an essential component of their therapeutic use. IGF-I levels are the first indicator of treatment efficacy and can be used to monitor compliance. High levels of IGF-I are a warning sign for the increased risk of potential adverse effects, such as acromegalic-like symptoms or malignancy. This could lead to a reduction of the therapeutic dose or the temporary interruption of treatment until IGF levels reach a safe range. IGF-I levels are also likely to increase with other hormones used in HIV patients, such as erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia or anabolic androgens in HIV-infected women.},

As a baseline, we first evaluated the GMM-based mapping considering dynamic features, proposed by Toda et al. (2007) for voice conversion. Then, we proposed a ‘phonetically-informed’ version of this technique, based on full-covariance HMM. This approach aims (1) at modeling explicitly the articulatory timing for each phonetic class, and (2) at exploiting linguistic knowledge to regularize the problem of silent speech conversion. Both techniques were compared on continuous speech, for two French speakers (one male, one female). For modal speech, the HMM-based technique showed a lower spectral distortion (objective evaluation). However, perceptual tests (transcription and XAB discrimination tests) showed a better intelligibility of the GMM-based technique, probably related to its less fluctuant quality. For silent speech, a perceptual identification test revealed a better segmental intelligibility for the HMM-based technique on consonants.},

  abstract      = {In this empirical study, we evaluate the extent to which a set of software measures are correlated with the number of faults and the total estimated repair effort for a large software system. The measures we use are basic counts reflecting program size and structure and metrics proposed by McCabe and Halstead. The effect of program size has a major influence on these metrics, and we present a suitable method of adjusting the metrics for size. In modeling faults or repair effort as a function of one variable, a number of measures individually explain approximately one-quarter of the variation observed in the fault data. No one measure does significantly better than size in explaining the variation in faults found across software units, and thus multiple variable models are necessary to find metrics of importance in addition to program size. The “best” multivariate model explains approximately one-half the variation in the fault data. The metrics included in this model (in addition to size) are: the ratio of block comments to total lines of code, the number of decisions per function, and the relative vocabulary of program variables and operators. These metrics have potential for future use in the quality control of software.},

  abstract      = {In this chapter, we describe some recent techniques and results in model-based testing of software product lines. Presently, more and more software-based products and services are available in many different variants to choose from. However, this brings about challenges for the software quality assurance processes. Since only few of all possible variants can be tested at the developer's site, several questions arise. How shall the variability be described in order to make sure that all features are being tested? Is it better to test selected variants on a concrete level, or shall the whole software product line be tested abstractly? What is the quality of a test suite for a product line, anyway? If it is impossible to test all possible variants, which products should be selected for testing? Given a certain product, which test cases are appropriate for it, and given a test case, which products can be tested with it? We address these questions from an empirical software engineering point of view. We sketch modeling formalisms for software product lines. Then, we compare domain-centered and application-centered approaches to software product line testing. We define mutation operators for assessing software product line test suites. Subsequently, we analyze methods for selecting product variants on the basis of a given test suite. Finally, we show how model checking can be used to determine whether a certain test case is applicable for a certain product variant. For all our methods we describe supporting tools and algorithms. Currently, we are integrating these in an integrated tool suite supporting several aspects of model-based testing for software product lines.},

  abstract      = {A common type of study used by researchers to map out the landscape of a research topic is known as mapping study. Such a study typically begins with an exploratory search on the possible ideas of the research topic, which is often done in an unsystematic manner. Hence, the activity of formulating research questions in mapping studies is ill-defined, rendering it difficult for researchers who are new to the topic. There is a need to guide them kicking off a mapping study of an unfamiliar domain. This paper proposes a 5W+1H pattern to help investigators systematically examine a generic set of dimensions in a mapping study toward the formulation of research questions before identifying, reading, and analyzing sufficient articles of the topic. We have validated the feasibility of our proposal by conducting a case study of a mapping study on cloud software testing, that is, software testing for and on cloud computing platforms. The case study reveals that the 5W+1H pattern can lead investigators to define a set of systematic, generic, and complementary research questions, enabling them to kick off and expedite the mapping study process in a well-defined manner. We also share our experiences and lessons learned from our case study on the use of the 5W+1H pattern in mapping studies.},

Among them, Voice over IP (VoIP) is the most prominent one. Beginning more as a frolic among computer enthusiasts, VoIP has set off a feeding frenzy in both the industrial and scientific communities and has the potential to radically change telephone communications. In this article, we survey all these aspects that have the greatest impact on the quality of voice communications over IP networks. The survey begins with the merits and demerits of VoIP, followed by the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements that voice imposes and a description of test methods for the assessment of speech quality. We then proceed with a delineation of the issues related to the conversion of analog voice to packets, namely we spell out the details of the most well-known voice codecs, while light is also thrown on voice activity detection and voice packetization. Header compression schemes receive intense scrutiny as well. We also provide an overview of the signaling protocols that are tailored to the needs of VoIP, and we continue with the comparison of the call admission schemes that are geared towards the QoS constraints of VoIP. The pivotal issue of security is then discussed, pointing out potential threats as well as approaches for tackling them. Finally, the survey concludes with a discussion on the feasibility of providing VoIP over challenging satellite links.},

  abstract      = {Component Based Software Development (CBSD) is focused on assembling existing components to build a software system, with a potential benefit of delivering quality systems by using quality components. It departs from the conventional software development process in that it is integration centric as opposed to development centric. The quality of a component based system using high quality components does not therefore necessarily guarantee a system of high quality, but depends on the quality of its components, and a framework and integration process used. Hence, techniques and methods for quality assurance and assessment of a component based system would be different from those of the traditional software engineering methodology. It is essential to quantify factors that contribute to the overall quality, for instances, the trade off between cost and quality of a component, analytical techniques and formal methods, and quality attribute definitions and measurements. This paper presents a literature survey of component based system quality assurance and assessment; the areas surveyed include formalism, cost estimation, and assessment and measurement techniques for the following quality attributes: performance, reliability, maintainability and testability. The aim of this survey is to help provide a better understanding of CBSD in these aspects in order to facilitate the realisation of its potential benefits of delivering quality systems.},

  abstract      = {Context
Variability management (VM) is one of the most important activities of software product-line engineering (SPLE), which intends to develop software-intensive systems using platforms and mass customization. VM encompasses the activities of eliciting and representing variability in software artefacts, establishing and managing dependencies among different variabilities, and supporting the exploitation of the variabilities for building and evolving a family of software systems. Software product line (SPL) community has allocated huge amount of effort to develop various approaches to dealing with variability related challenges during the last two decade. Several dozens of VM approaches have been reported. However, there has been no systematic effort to study how the reported VM approaches have been evaluated.
Objective
The objectives of this research are to review the status of evaluation of reported VM approaches and to synthesize the available evidence about the effects of the reported approaches.
Method
We carried out a systematic literature review of the VM approaches in SPLE reported from 1990s until December 2007.
Results
We selected 97 papers according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected papers appeared in 56 publication venues. We found that only a small number of the reviewed approaches had been evaluated using rigorous scientific methods. A detailed investigation of the reviewed studies employing empirical research methods revealed significant quality deficiencies in various aspects of the used quality assessment criteria. The synthesis of the available evidence showed that all studies, except one, reported only positive effects.
Conclusion
The findings from this systematic review show that a large majority of the reported VM approaches have not been sufficiently evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods. The available evidence is sparse and the quality of the presented evidence is quite low. The findings highlight the areas in need of improvement, i.e., rigorous evaluation of VM approaches. However, the reported evidence is quite consistent across different studies. That means the proposed approaches may be very beneficial when they are applied properly in appropriate situations. Hence, it can be concluded that further investigations need to pay more attention to the contexts under which different approaches can be more beneficial.},

  abstract      = {Context
Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging discipline that focuses on the application of search-based optimization techniques to software engineering problems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems whose members are distinguished by the set of features each one provides. SPL development practices have proven benefits such as improved software reuse, better customization, and faster time to market. A typical SPL usually involves a large number of systems and features, a fact that makes them attractive for the application of SBSE techniques which are able to tackle problems that involve large search spaces.
Objective
The main objective of our work is to identify the quantity and the type of research on the application of SBSE techniques to SPL problems. More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published.
Method
A systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014.
Results
The most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation.
Conclusions
Our study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions.},

Previous studies have shown that blocking DLL4 signaling reduced tumor growth by disrupting productive angiogenesis. We developed selective anti-human and anti-mouse DLL4 antibodies to dissect the mechanisms involved by analyzing the contributions of selectively targeting DLL4 in the tumor or in the host vasculature and stroma in xenograft models derived from primary human tumors. We found that each antibody inhibited tumor growth and that the combination of the two antibodies was more effective than either alone. Treatment with anti-human DLL4 inhibited the expression of Notch target genes and reduced proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore, we found that specifically inhibiting human DLL4 in the tumor, either alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan, reduced cancer stem cell frequency, as shown by flow cytometric and in vivo tumorigenicity studies.},

While sophisticated software tools parse source code to gain access to the program's structure, many lightweight programming aids such as grep rely instead on only the lexical structure of source code. I describe a new XML application that provides an alternative representation of Java source code. This XML-based representation, called JavaML, is more natural for tools and permits easy specification of numerous software-engineering analyses by leveraging the abundance of XML tools and techniques. A robust converter built with the Jikes Java compiler framework translates from the classical Java source code representation to JavaML, and an XSLT stylesheet converts from JavaML back into the classical textual form.},

The key challenges currently being addressed are related to UAV platform properties such as functionality, reliability, fault tolerance, and endurance, which are all tightly linked to the UAV flight controller hardware and software. The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research. This paper presents a survey of the publicly available open-source drone platform elements that can be used for research and development. The survey covers open-source hardware, software, and simulation drone platforms and compares their main features.},

This chapter outlines two conceptual case studies as well as a real world case study, which together demonstrate how Internet Protocol (IP)-based services can be developed and deployed by service providers to generate revenue. The case studies emphasize the role of operations support system (OSS), architecture in implementing IP-based services. The two conceptual case studies are composites of real experiences of various service providers. The combination of these two conceptual studies with a real-world example demonstrates the full impact of IP in both business and technical aspects. The conceptual case studies present scenarios for both Greenfield and incumbent service providers. The conceptual case studies and the Meta Telecom experience have drawn a picture of the business and technical aspects associated with IP-based service creation. There are common success factors in all three examples that include upper-management support and vision to use IP technology to transform a company, the redefinition of business–engineering processes for company-wide IP-based service development and deployment, an emphasis on OSS architecture as the base for service creation, and, finally, the positive interaction between customers, service providers, and vendors.},

Background & aims
Nutrition is the major environmental factor that influences the risk of developing pathologies, such as obesity. Although a number of recent reviews pinpoint a protective effects of milk on body weight and obesity related co-morbidities, an inaccurate estimate of milk might contribute to hamper its beneficial effects on health outcomes. Seven-day food records provide prospective food intake data, reducing recall bias and providing extra details about specific food items. Milk intake stimulates the somatotropic axis at multiple levels by increasing both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secretion. On the other hand, obesity is associated with reduced spontaneous and stimulated GH secretion and basal IGF-1 levels. Aim of this study was to evaluate the milk consumption by using the 7-days food record in obese individuals and to investigate the association between milk intake and GH secretory status in these subjects.
Methods
Cross-sectional observational study carried out on 281 adult individuals (200 women and 81 men, aged 18–74 years) with moderate-severe obesity (BMI 35.2–69.4 kg/m2). Baseline milk intake data were collected using a 7 day food record. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical profile were determined. The GH/IGF-1 axis was evaluated by peak GH response after GHRH + ARGININE and IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS).
Results
The majority of individuals (72.2%) reported consuming milk; 250 mL low-fat milk was the most frequently serving of milk consumed, while no subjects reported to consume whole milk. Milk consumers vs no milk consumers presented the better anthropometric measurements and metabolic profile. At the bivariate proportional odds ratio model, after adjusting for BMI, age and gender, milk consumption was associated the better GH status (OR = 0.60; p < 0.001). Among milk consumers, subjects consuming 250 mL reduced-fat milk vs 250 mL low-fat milk presented the better anthropometric measurements and metabolic profile. At the bivariate proportional odds ratio model, after adjusting for BMI, age and gender, the consume of 250 mL reduced-fat milk was associated better GH status (OR = 0.54; p = 0.003).
Conclusions
A novel positive association between milk consumption, GH status, and metabolic profile in obese individuals was evidenced. Regardless of the pathogenetic mechanisms, this novel association might be relevant in a context where commonly obese individuals skip breakfast, and suggests the need of a growing cooperation between Nutritionists and Endocrinologists in the management of the obese patients.},

Here resilience refers to a 3S-oriented design, that is, stability, security, and systematicness: Stability means the CPS can achieve a stable sensing-actuation close-loop control even though the inputs (sensing data) have noise or attacks; Security means that the system can overcome the cyber–physical interaction attacks; and Systematicness means that the system has a seamless integration of sensors and actuators. We will also explain the CPS modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic CPS design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of CPS security principle. The dominant feature of this survey is that it has both principle discussions and practical cyber–physical coupling design.},

This chapter establishes a series of related principles that both support the architectural analysis and serve as high-level scoping and requirements for the value system. The chapter attempts to build a new kind of process framework for large scale IT management in the enterprise. The concept of an overall IT value chain and the four major, long-lived value streams of large-scale enterprise information technology (application services, infrastructure services, IT assets, and IT technology products) are discussed in the chapter. The shorter IT processes are also elaborated. The process architecture is represented as a set of larger-grained lifecycles that are acted upon by a series of well- understood IT processes with clear beginnings and endings. Value streams and processes are the key means by which value is delivered in IT, as in any business. A relentless attention to reducing unnecessary activity along these activity sequences is essential to increasing value. Synchronization points, dependencies, and critical paths would all be of interest, and constitute the foundation of IT value stream analysis. Much in IT is related to nonprocess concepts: quality concepts such as capacity and availability, or the actual functional areas that own the various lifecycles and processes. An overall systems architecture is presented for the business of IT, discussing fundamentals of enterprise application architecture and the major classes of systems encountered in IT management. Summary matrices are introduced in this discussion as a means of showing how the various architectural elements may interact.},

One of the most important differentiators between embedded and general-purpose computing is that embedded systems typically run one single application or set of applications exclusively. This affects many aspects of computing, including code development. Although in most respects, embedded application development resembles general code development, special languages can play a role when the application under development will be embedded in a product because of different lifetime, user community, and underlying hardware considerations. Similarly, the process of making code perform can well change. Techniques that might be unacceptable in the general-purpose world can be almost essential in the embedded world, in which a product may be of no use if it cannot meet a speed or power requirement. Embedded computing is unique in that the hardware too is built to run a single application, and thus methodologies for customization become relevant. This topic is part of the larger area of hardware/software codesign. Embedded designers face issues at the hardware/software boundary that are closed to designers of general-purpose systems. Customized hardware presents an opportunity to vastly speed up individual applications. This opportunity has led to a lively research area and the foundation of more than a few startup companies.},

  abstract      = {Aspect-oriented programming languages extend existing languages with new features for supporting modularization of crosscutting concerns. These features however make existing source code analysis tools unable to reason over this code. Consequently, all code analysis efforts of aspect-oriented code that we are aware of have either built limited analysis tools or were performed manually. Given the significant complexity of building them or manual analysis, a lot of duplication of effort could have been avoided by using a general-purpose tool. To address this, in this paper we present Gasr: a source code analysis tool that reasons over AspectJ source code, which may contain metadata in the form of annotations. GASR provides multiple kinds of analyses that are general enough such that they are reusable, tailorable and can reason over annotations. We demonstrate the use of GASR in two ways: we first automate the recognition of previously identified aspectual source code assumptions. Second, we turn implicit assumptions into explicit assumptions through annotations and automate their verification. In both uses GASR performs detection and verification of aspect assumptions on two well-known case studies that were manually investigated in earlier work. GASR finds already known aspect assumptions and adds instances that had been previously overlooked.},

The chapter presents the overview of the present status of software science. Software science is an intellectually exciting discipline currently undergoing rapid development. Software science can be treated as a proper basis or foundation for the field of software engineering, but not as synonymous with it. This is not unlike other branches, in that the engineering usually preceded and indeed stimulated the development of the underlying science. It is interesting to note, however, that it is only after the development of thermodynamics for power engineering, electrodynamics for electrical engineering, or statics, dynamics, and strength-of-materials for mechanical engineering that those branches could be considered quasi complete, highly competent, and dependable engineering disciplines. Such a goal for software engineering clearly motivates much of the work in software science. Despite the fact that there are no theorems, and perhaps never can be any, in the field of software science, one basic attribute shared by the equations in this field has become quite noticeable. This is the total and complete lack of arbitrary constants or unknown coefficients among the basic equations. It cannot yet be predicted what impact this discipline may be expected to have on the field of software engineering, or of computer programming in general in the future, but perhaps its greatest impact may result from one conclusion that seems inescapable. This conclusion is that natural laws govern language and the mental activity of using it far more strictly than previously recognized.},
